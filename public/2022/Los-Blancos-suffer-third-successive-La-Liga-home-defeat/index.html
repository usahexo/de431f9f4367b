        <h1 id="Los-Blancos-suffer-third-successive-La-Liga-home-defeat"><a href="#Los-Blancos-suffer-third-successive-La-Liga-home-defeat" class="headerlink" title="Los Blancos suffer third successive La Liga home defeat"></a>Los Blancos suffer third successive La Liga home defeat</h1><p>Real Madrid slumped to their third successive home defeat in La Liga as they went down 2-1 to Villarreal on Saturday.</p>
<p>The result means that Los Blancos have now lost four of their last five matches in all competitions, and they remain four points adrift of fourth-placed Valencia.</p>
<p>Villarreal took the lead in the first half through Manu Trigueros, before Cristiano Ronaldo levelled things up shortly after the interval. However, Samu Castillejo restored Villarreal’s lead soon afterwards and they held on for the win.</p>
<p>Real Madrid began brightly and almost took the lead in the sixth minute, but Karim Benzema’s header came back off the crossbar. Villarreal gradually grew into the game and took the lead in the 20th minute through Trigueros, who finished neatly from close range following a well-worked team move.</p>
<p>The hosts continued to press for an equaliser and eventually got one through Ronaldo in the 47th minute. The Portuguese superstar volleyed home from 12 yards out after Luka Modric had played him in with a superb ball over the top.</p>
<p>However, Villarreal hit back immediately through Castillejo, who raced clear before finishing clinically past Keylor Navas. The visitors went on to hold on for the win, despite Real Madrid’s best efforts to find an equaliser.</p>
<p>It was a hugely disappointing result for Santiago Solari’s side, who are now facing an uphill task if they are to qualify for next season’s Champions League.</p>
<h1 id="Atletico-Madrid-return-to-winning-ways-with-2-1-victory-over-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Atletico-Madrid-return-to-winning-ways-with-2-1-victory-over-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Atlético Madrid return to winning ways with 2-1 victory over Real Madrid"></a>Atlético Madrid return to winning ways with 2-1 victory over Real Madrid</h1><p>Atlético Madrid secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory over rivals Real Madrid in La Liga on Saturday. Antoine Griezmann scored both goals for the home side, with Karim Benzema netting a late consolation for Madrid.</p>
<p>It was a lively opening to the match at the Wanda Metropolitano, with Atlético quickly establishing themselves as the dominant force. Griezmann came close to putting the hosts ahead in the 11th minute but his effort sailed just wide of the post.</p>
<p>The breakthrough finally came in the 27th minute, with Griezmann volleying home from close range following a well-worked free-kick. Madrid responded before half-time but they were unable to find an equaliser, with Thibaut Courtois making some fine saves to keep them at bay.</p>
<p>Atlético continued to dominate after the break and they doubled their lead in the 67th minute, with Griezmann scoring his second of the game with a well-placed finish. Los Blancos did pull one back in injury time through Benzema, but it was too little, too late as Atlético held on for all three points.</p>
<p>The result sees Diego Simeone’s side move up to second place in La Liga, just two points behind leaders Barcelona. Meanwhile, Real Madrid have now lost two of their last three league games and they find themselves down in fifth place.</p>
<h1 id="Diego-Costa-scores-winner-on-Atleti-return"><a href="#Diego-Costa-scores-winner-on-Atleti-return" class="headerlink" title="Diego Costa scores winner on Atleti return"></a>Diego Costa scores winner on Atleti return</h1><p>Diego Costa marked his return to Atletico Madrid with a last-minute winner in a 2-1 victory over Getafe on Saturday.</p>
<p>The striker, who rejoined the club from Chelsea in January, had not played for Atleti since 2014 due to a falling out with then-coach Diego Simeone.</p>
<p>But he came off the bench to score the decisive goal at the Wanda Metropolitano, stabbing home Antoine Griezmann’s cross in the 90th minute.</p>
<p>“It was very emotional to score that goal and win in my first game back,” Costa said. “I’m very happy.”</p>
<p>Atletico had taken an early lead through Jorge “Koke” Resurreccion, but Getafe equalised shortly before halftime through Faycal Fajr.</p>
<p>Simeone’s side have now won four La Liga games in a row to close the gap on fourth-placed Real Madrid to four points.</p>
<h1 id="Cristiano-Ronaldo-scores-400th-career-goal-in-derby-draw"><a href="#Cristiano-Ronaldo-scores-400th-career-goal-in-derby-draw" class="headerlink" title="Cristiano Ronaldo scores 400th career goal in derby draw"></a>Cristiano Ronaldo scores 400th career goal in derby draw</h1><p>Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player ever to score in every minute of a La Liga game as he registered his 400th career goal in a 1-1 draw with Barcelona. The Portuguese international opened the scoring at the Nou Camp in the third minute and then found the net again in the 90th minute, meaning he has now scored in every minute of a La Liga game.</p>
<p>Ronaldo’s strike was his fifth goal in this season’s El Clasico fixtures and it means he has now overtaken Alfredo Di Stefano as Real Madrid’s all-time top scorer in derby games. The 33-year-old has now scored 23 goals against Barcelona, four more than any other player.</p>
<p>“It was an important goal because it was in a difficult match against a tough opponent,” Ronaldo said afterwards. “To score 400 goals for any club is not easy, so I am very happy. It was a difficult match but we deserved to win because we played better. Football is like that, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. We have to continue doing our job.”</p>
<p>This season, Ronaldo has already scored 29 goals in just 27 appearances for Real Madrid and he is on course to break his own record of 50 goals set last season.</p>
<h1 id="Atletico-Madrid-stay-unbeaten-in-La-Liga-under-Diego-Simeone"><a href="#Atletico-Madrid-stay-unbeaten-in-La-Liga-under-Diego-Simeone" class="headerlink" title="Atlético Madrid stay unbeaten in La Liga under Diego Simeone"></a>Atlético Madrid stay unbeaten in La Liga under Diego Simeone</h1><p>In the five and a half years since Diego Simeone took charge of Atlético Madrid, they have never been relegated from La Liga and they have only missed out on Europe once. This season is no different, as they are still unbeaten in La Liga and currently sit in second place – just two points behind Barcelona.</p>
<p>There have been a few bumps in the road this season, with Atlético losing to Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final and also suffering defeat to Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup. However, they have bounced back each time and currently sit top of their Europa League group.</p>
<p>Under Diego Simeone, Atlético Madrid have become one of the most successful clubs in Europe. They have won the Europa League twice, the Copa del Rey once and La Liga twice. They have also reached two Champions League finals, but unfortunately lost both times.</p>
<p>Despite all their success under Simeone, there have been reports that he could be leaving Atlético at the end of this season. He has been linked with a number of jobs, including Arsenal and Manchester United, but nothing has been confirmed as yet.</p>
<p>If Diego Simeone does leave Atlético Madrid at the end of this season, it will be a massive loss for the club. He has done an incredible job over the past five and a half years and has turned Atlético into one of the best clubs in Europe.</p>
