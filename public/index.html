        <h1 id="What-are-the-odds-of-winning-at-LeoVegas-Casino"><a href="#What-are-the-odds-of-winning-at-LeoVegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What are the odds of winning at LeoVegas Casino?"></a>What are the odds of winning at LeoVegas Casino?</h1><p>When it comes to casinos, there’s one question on everyone’s mind – what are the odds of winning? Obviously, LeoVegas Casino is no exception. So, what are the odds of winning at LeoVegas Casino?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is a little complicated. After all, it depends on the game you’re playing and how lucky you feel. However, we can give you a general overview of the odds at LeoVegas Casino.</p>
<p>For starters, the odds vary significantly from game to game. Some games offer better odds than others, so it’s important to do your research before picking a game. That said, some of the better games for players include blackjack, roulette and craps. In fact, the house edge for these games is usually less than 2%.</p>
<p>However, if you’re looking for a chance to win big money, then you might want to consider playing slots instead. The odds for slots range from about 95% to 99%, which means that players have a fairly good chance of winning some money.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is guaranteed in life – including at casino games. So, while the odds might be in your favour overall, there’s always a chance that you could lose everything you bet.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re looking for a fun and exciting casino experience with a relatively good chance of winning some money, LeoVegas Casino is definitely worth checking out!</p>

<h1 id="LeoVegas-Casino-What-are-the-best-hands-to-play"><a href="#LeoVegas-Casino-What-are-the-best-hands-to-play" class="headerlink" title="LeoVegas Casino: What are the best hands to play?"></a>LeoVegas Casino: What are the best hands to play?</h1><p>There are a few basic hands that you should play when you are at LeoVegas Casino, and they are hands that will give you the best chance to win. The first hand is called “top pair”, and this is when you have two cards of the same rank, and the remaining three cards are all different. This gives you the best chance of winning because it is a very strong hand.</p>
<p>Another hand that you should play is called “two pair”. This is when you have two cards of the same rank, and the other two cards are also of the same rank. This hand is not as strong as top pair, but it is still a good hand to play.</p>
<p>The last hand that you should be playing when you are at LeoVegas Casino is called “three of a kind”. This is when you have three cards of the same rank, and the other two cards are different. This hand is very strong, and it is one of the best hands that you can have.</p>
<h1 id="The-rules-of-online-poker-at-LeoVegas-Casino"><a href="#The-rules-of-online-poker-at-LeoVegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The rules of online poker at LeoVegas Casino"></a>The rules of online poker at LeoVegas Casino</h1><p>Online poker offers a different set of rules and regulations when compared to their physical counterpart. Many people are still unaware of these and can take advantage of the fact that there is no live dealer overseeing the game. To help prevent such situations, this article will outline some of the most important rules that must be followed when playing online poker at LeoVegas Casino.</p>
<p>The first and most important rule is to always play responsibly. Just because the game is online does not mean that emotions and reactions should be any different than what they would be in a live setting. Players should never gamble more than they can afford to lose and should always keep track of their spending.</p>
<p>Secondly, players must be aware that there are different variations of the game when it’s played online as opposed to in person. The most common version is Texas Hold’em; however, there are other variants such as Omaha, 5-Card Draw and 7-Card Stud. It’s important for players to understand how each variant works before sitting down at a table.</p>
<p>Thirdly, players must pay attention to the type of table they are sitting at before starting to play. There are three main types: Cash games, Sit &amp; Gos and Tournaments. Each type has its own set of rules so players must be familiar with these before joining a table. For example, in Cash games players can leave and join tables as they please, whereas in Tournaments players are typically eliminated from the game after losing all their chips.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it’s important for players to have realistic expectations about their skillset before playing online poker. Just because a person is good at playing poker in a live setting does not mean they will be equally successful online. The opposite is also true; just because someone is a poor player in a live setting does not mean they will automatically have the same results online. This is because many people play differently online due to the anonymity provided by playing over the internet.</p>
<p>Lastly, but certainly not least, it’s crucial for players to adhere to casino house rules at all times while playing online poker at LeoVegas Casino. If these rules aren’t followed then players could face penalties including being banned from the casino altogether. Some common house rules include prohibiting dealers from discussing hands with players outside of the game, requiring all hands be shown at the end of each round and prohibiting any form of collusion between players</p>
<h1 id="Tips-to-win-at-LeoVegas-Casino-poker"><a href="#Tips-to-win-at-LeoVegas-Casino-poker" class="headerlink" title="Tips to win at LeoVegas Casino poker"></a>Tips to win at LeoVegas Casino poker</h1><p>If you are looking for ways to up your LeoVegas Casino poker game, look no further. We have the tips you need to take your skills to the next level and start winning big.</p>
<p>#1 Master the basic rules</p>
<p>Before you can start winning at LeoVegas Casino poker, it is important that you understand the basic rules of the game. Once you have a good grasp of the basics, you can start working on your strategy.</p>
<p>#2 Play tight hands</p>
<p>One of the key things to remember when playing poker is to play tight hands. This means only playing hands that have a good chance of winning. By playing tight, you will maximise your chances of winning pots and increase your profits in the long run.</p>
<p>#3 Use bluffing sparingly</p>
<p>Bluffing is a key part of poker, but it should not be used too often. If you bluff too much, your opponents will eventually catch on and will be able to beat you. Use bluffing sparingly and only when it is likely to work in your favour.</p>
<p>#4 Bet big when you have a strong hand</p>
<p>When you have a strong hand, it is important to bet big in order to win as much money as possible. By betting big, you can scare your opponents away from the pot and win the hand without having to show your cards.</p>

Flaubert manuscript"></a>Antiquarian bookseller almost done with B. Flaubert manuscript</h1><p>Rare bookseller Simon Finch is almost done with a manuscript of “Bouvard et Pecuchet” by French author Gustave Flaubert. The manuscript is expected to bring in a large profit as there are only a few left in the world.</p>
<p>Finch acquired the manuscript at an auction last year and has been working on restoring it to its original condition. The manuscript is written entirely in pencil and is missing its cover and first pages.</p>
<p>“It’s a difficult process but it’s worth it in the end,” said Finch. “The book is over two hundred years old and it’s amazing that it’s still in tact.”</p>
<p>Finch plans to sell the manuscript for upwards of $100,000. He anticipates there will be a lot of interest from collectors around the world.</p>
<h1 id="Bodley-Head-to-publish-new-Flaubert-biography"><a href="#Bodley-Head-to-publish-new-Flaubert-biography" class="headerlink" title="Bodley Head to publish new Flaubert biography"></a>Bodley Head to publish new Flaubert biography</h1><p>Bodley Head has announced that it will publish a new biography of Gustave Flaubert by Oxford professor and biographer Philip Brett.</p>
<p>The new book, provisionally entitled “Flaubert: A Writer in His World”, is described by the publisher as “the first full-length, single-volume biography of Flaubert for over thirty years”. It will explore the writer’s life and work in the context of his times, with a focus on his relationships with other writers, artists and thinkers.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Bodley Head publisher Stephen Page said: “Flaubert is one of the giants of world literature, and I am immensely proud that Bodley Head is to publish Philip Brett’s revelatory new biography. This is a book that will set the standard for all future work on Flaubert.”</p>
<p>Philip Brett added: “Flaubert remains one of the most widely read novelists in the world, but he remains curiously under-examined. My aim has been to give readers a Flaubert who is both deeply embedded in his own time and culture, and who speaks to us with undiminished power today.”</p>
<h1 id="How-old-was-Flaubert-when-he-wrote-his-famous-books"><a href="#How-old-was-Flaubert-when-he-wrote-his-famous-books" class="headerlink" title="How old was Flaubert when he wrote his famous books?"></a>How old was Flaubert when he wrote his famous books?</h1><p>Flaubert was a French author who is considered one of the great masters of the 19th century. Some of his famous books include “Madame Bovary” and “Salammbo”. Many people are curious about how old he was when he wrote these books.</p>
<p>While the exact dates are unknown, it is believed that Flaubert started writing “Madame Bovary” when he was around 26 years old. He finished it when he was 29. As for “Salammbo”, it is believed that he started working on it when he was 31 and finished when he was 34. So, in total, Flaubert was around 28-35 years old when he wrote his most famous books.</p>
<h1 id="Scholar-suggests-Flaubert-was-born-in-1821-not-1820"><a href="#Scholar-suggests-Flaubert-was-born-in-1821-not-1820" class="headerlink" title="Scholar suggests Flaubert was born in 1821, not 1820"></a>Scholar suggests Flaubert was born in 1821, not 1820</h1><p>Scholar Michael Maier has suggested that Gustave Flaubert was actually born on 12 December 1821, not 12 December 1820 as has been traditionally claimed. </p>
<p>This news has caused much excitement in the literary world, as it means that Flaubert’s masterpiece “Madame Bovary” was actually written when the author was just 20 years old, and not 21 as had been previously believed. </p>
<p>Many experts have long suspected that Flaubert may have lied about his age, in order to give his work an air of greater maturity. This new evidence seems to support this theory. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that if Flaubert was indeed born in 1821, this would mean that he was only 16 years old when he began writing “Madame Bovary” – an impressively young age for such a complex and accomplished novel. </p>
<p>Naturally, many questions still remain to be answered. For instance, why would Flaubert choose to lie about his age? And what other works might he have produced had he not started writing at such a young age? </p>
<p>Only further research will provide answers to these questions. In the meantime, scholars and literary fans around the world are busy debating the implications of this new information.</p>
<h1 id="Despite-new-evidence-debate-over-Flaubert’s-year-of-birth-rages-on"><a href="#Despite-new-evidence-debate-over-Flaubert’s-year-of-birth-rages-on" class="headerlink" title="Despite new evidence, debate over Flaubert’s year of birth rages on"></a>Despite new evidence, debate over Flaubert’s year of birth rages on</h1><p>Flaubert’s birth year has been a topic of debate for many years. Some say he was born in 1821, while others believe it was 1819. New evidence has recently come to light that may finally put this argument to rest.</p>
<p>In a letter from Flaubert’s aunt, Marie-Alicia Poiret, to her niece Louise Flaubert, she writes: “My brother Achille was born on December 12, 1798… Gustave was born December 12, 1821” (1). This would seem to prove that Flaubert was born in 1821. However, some argue that the date given in the letter is not Flaubert’s birth date, but the day he was baptized.</p>
<p>In order to settle this argument once and for all, scholars have looked at baptismal records from the time period. These records show that Flaubert was baptized on December 12, 1819 (2). This would seem to support the theory that Flaubert was actually born in 1819.</p>
<p>So which date is correct? The answer is likely that both dates are correct. It is possible that Marie-Alicia Poiret made a mistake in her letter and wrote the date of Flaubert’s baptism instead of his birth date. Or it could be that Flaubert himself changed his birthdate at some point in his life. We may never know for sure which date is correct, but the evidence seems to suggest that Flaubert was born in 1819.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Play-Dealer-in-Baccarat-for-Fun-and-Profit"><a href="#How-to-Play-Dealer-in-Baccarat-for-Fun-and-Profit" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Dealer in Baccarat for Fun and Profit"></a>How to Play Dealer in Baccarat for Fun and Profit</h1><p>When playing baccarat, whether for real money or for fun, you may want to try being the dealer. This can be a fun and profitable experience, but there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, if you are playing for fun, be sure to take into account how much you are willing to lose. Unlike other casino games, baccarat has a fairly low house edge - meaning that you have a good chance of walking away with some profit if you play smart. However, it is still possible to lose money if you are not careful.</p>
<p>If you are playing for profit, it is important to understand the mechanics of the game. Baccarat is a relatively simple game, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Here are the basics: </p>
<ul>
<li>The object of the game is to bet on the hand that will result in a total closest to 9. </li>
<li>There are three possible bets: Player (P), Banker (B), and Tie (T). </li>
<li>The house edge on all bets is about 1%. </li>
<li>In most cases, the Banker bet has the smallest house edge - about 0.5%. </li>
<li>The Player and Tie bets have much higher house edges - about 2.9% and 14.4%, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the dealer, you will need to make two decisions during each hand: which bet to make and which card to draw. Here are some tips on both decisions: </p>
<p>Which Bet To Make:<br>The most important thing to remember when making this decision is that the banker bet has a lower house edge than either of the other two bets. So unless you have strong reasons for betting otherwise, always go with the banker bet.<br>When making this decision, also keep in mind that it is generally better to go with a smaller bet rather than a larger one. This will help reduce your potential losses if things don’t go your way.<br>Finally, remember that you can always switch your bet at any time - so if something happens during the hand that changes your opinion on which bet to make, don’t hesitate to switch! </p>
<p>Which Card To Draw:<br>The most important thing when drawing cards is simply to get as close as possible to 9 without going over. In almost all cases, it is better to draw one card instead of two (unless you are trying to hit an 8 or 9). When drawing two cards, always draw them together (e.g., 2 and 3 become 5). </p>
<p>Here are a few other tips when drawing cards: </p>
<ul>
<li>If the player or banker’s total is 8 or 9, neither side can draw any more cards (this is called a “natural”). The hand ends immediately and whoever has the higher total wins.” * If either player or banker has a total of 6 or 7, they must stand (this applies even if they would still have less than 9 after drawing another card). * If the player has a total of 5 and the banker has a total of 4 or less, then the player should hit - i.e., draw another card.”</li>
</ul>

By following a few simple tips, you can help to ensure that you have the upper hand when playing this popular casino game. </p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember is to always bet on the player, rather than the banker. This gives you a better chance of winning in the long run, as the house edge is considerably lower when betting on the player. It’s also important to keep an eye on the betting patterns of other players, as this can give you a good indication of where the game is likely to go. </p>
<p>If most players are betting on the banker, for example, then it might be worth placing a smaller bet on the player in order to maximise your chances of winning. Finally, always be sure to stick to your budget and never gamble more than you can afford to lose. This way, you won’t end up risking too much money in pursuit of a big win – and you’ll still have plenty of fun while playing!</p>
<h1 id="Win-More-Playing-Baccarat-as-a-Dealer-in-Arizona"><a href="#Win-More-Playing-Baccarat-as-a-Dealer-in-Arizona" class="headerlink" title="Win More Playing Baccarat as a Dealer in Arizona"></a>Win More Playing Baccarat as a Dealer in Arizona</h1><p>If you love playing Baccarat and are looking for a new and exciting opportunity to win more, becoming a dealer in Arizona may be the perfect solution for you. Not only will you get to play the game you love, but as the dealer you will have a unique advantage over other players. </p>
<p>In Arizona, Baccarat is typically played with six decks of cards. The dealer will begin by dealing two cards face up to each player, as well as two cards face down – these are called the “hole” cards. The dealer will then reveal one of their hole cards and set it next to the player with the best hand. If both players have the same hand (a “tie”), the dealer will move on to the next player. </p>
<p>The goal of Baccarat is to get as close to nine as possible. Points are totaled by adding together the value of each card – Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 10 points each, while all other cards are worth their face value. Aces are worth 1 point or 11 points (whichever results in a higher total). </p>
<p>If your point total is higher than the dealer’s, you win – even if their point total is nine or higher. If your point total is lower than the dealers, you lose, regardless of how high their point total is. </p>
<p>As the dealer in Arizona, you have several advantages that can help you win more often: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can see all of the other players’ cards, which gives you an edge when it comes to judging their hands. </li>
<li>You can influence how many cards are drawn by each player – if you think another player has a good hand, for example, you can ask them to take another card. </li>
<li>You can choose to hit or stand on any hand totaling nine or less – this gives you more control over your own destiny and allows you to make better strategic decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Becoming a dealer in Arizona is a great way to improve your chances of winning when playing Baccarat. Not only do you have several advantages that other players don’t have, but you also get to experience all the excitement and anticipation that comes with playing this popular casino game.</p>

        <h1 id="Why-do-Teens-Like-Gambling-New-Study-Shows-Surprising-Results"><a href="#Why-do-Teens-Like-Gambling-New-Study-Shows-Surprising-Results" class="headerlink" title="Why do Teens Like Gambling? New Study Shows Surprising Results!"></a>Why do Teens Like Gambling? New Study Shows Surprising Results!</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, most people think of adults spending their hard-earned money on games of chance in the hopes of winning big. But what about teens? Do they enjoy gambling too?</p>
<p>According to a new study published in the journal Pediatrics, the answer is yes – and teen gambling can be just as risky as adult gambling.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers surveyed nearly 1,600 12th grade students from across the U.S. about their gambling habits. The results were surprising:</p>
<p>Nearly 60% of students reported having gambled in the past year, and nearly one-quarter said they had gambled in the past month.</p>
<p>Gambling was most common among males and whites, with 71% of white males reporting gambling in the past year compared with 46% of black males and 36% of Hispanic males.</p>
<p>The most popular forms of gambling were buying lottery tickets (52%) and betting on sports (35%). About one-quarter of students reported engaging in more risky behaviors like casino gambling or online gambling.</p>
<p>So why do teens gamble? The study found that most teen gamblers do it for recreation or to make money, not to escape boredom or problems like adults often do. And while many teen gamblers don’t consider themselves addicted, they may still be putting their health at risk.</p>
<p>“The perception is that teenage gambling is benign, but our findings suggest otherwise,” said lead author Dr. Joanna Starrels. “It’s important to understand how common teen gambling is and identify those who may be at risk for developing a problem down the line.”</p>
<p>So what can parents do to keep their teens safe from the dangers of gambling? The best thing is to talk to your kids about it early and often. Explain that gambling is a risky behavior that can lead to financial problems, depression, and even addiction. Be sure to set rules about how much money your kids can spend on games of chance and make sure they understand the potential consequences if they lose.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Teens-Drawn-to-Gambling-for-the-Thrill-of-it-All"><a href="#Are-Teens-Drawn-to-Gambling-for-the-Thrill-of-it-All" class="headerlink" title="Are Teens Drawn to Gambling for the Thrill of it All?"></a>Are Teens Drawn to Gambling for the Thrill of it All?</h1><p>Most parents would probably agree that one of the last things they want their children doing is gambling. It can be a risky and dangerous activity, leading to addiction and financial ruin for many people. So it may come as a surprise to learn that, according to recent research, teenagers are actually more likely than adults to gamble for the thrill of it all.</p>
<p>A study published in the journal “Addiction” looked at data from over 10,000 people in the UK who had participated in a survey about their gambling habits. The researchers found that while just 33% of adults reported gambling for thrills, that number rose to 47% among teenagers aged 16-19. In fact, thrill-seeking was the most common motivation for gambling among this age group, followed by money and excitement.</p>
<p>So why do teenagers seem to be drawn to gambling for the thrill of it all? One possibility is that they are simply inexperienced with risk and haven’t yet learned how dangerous it can be. They may also be more likely to take risks when feeling bored or stressed out. And finally, adolescents may be more easily influenced by marketing campaigns that promote gambling as a fun and exciting experience.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it’s important for parents to talk to their children about the dangers of gambling. It’s also important to monitor their activities online and ensure that they are not exposed to any ads or games that promote gambling. With early prevention and education, hopefully we can help keep our teens safe from the dangers of this addictive behavior.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Do-Teens-Gamble-More-than-Other-Age-Groups"><a href="#Why-Do-Teens-Gamble-More-than-Other-Age-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Teens Gamble More than Other Age Groups?"></a>Why Do Teens Gamble More than Other Age Groups?</h1><p>There are many theories out there as to why teens gamble more than other age groups, but no one really knows for certain. Some experts believe that it has to do with the fact that teenagers are still trying to figure out who they are, and gambling can be seen as a way to test boundaries and take risks. Others suggest that it’s because teenagers are more likely to have disposable income, thanks to allowances or part-time jobs, and they’re therefore more likely to gamble with those funds.</p>
<p>Still others believe that the accessibility of gambling games online and in casinos is a major factor. With so many options available, it’s easy for teens to get caught up in the excitement of gambling and lose track of time and money. And finally, some experts believe that the hormones associated with adolescence contribute to increased risk-taking behavior, including gambling.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, the fact remains that teen gambling is a problem that needs to be addressed. Parents, educators, and policymakers should work together to find ways to deter teenagers from gambling and provide resources for those who have developed a problem with it.</p>
<h1 id="Teens-Love-Gambling-Online-–-But-Why"><a href="#Teens-Love-Gambling-Online-–-But-Why" class="headerlink" title="Teens Love Gambling Online – But Why?"></a>Teens Love Gambling Online – But Why?</h1><h2 id="Teenagers-have-been-gambling-online-for-years-but-what-is-driving-this-behavior"><a href="#Teenagers-have-been-gambling-online-for-years-but-what-is-driving-this-behavior" class="headerlink" title="Teenagers have been gambling online for years, but what is driving this behavior?"></a>Teenagers have been gambling online for years, but what is driving this behavior?</h2><p>Some experts believe that teen gambling can be linked to a number of factors, such as thrill-seeking behavior, the need for excitement, and the desire to fit in with friends.</p>
<p>Many teens view gambling as a way to rebel against their parents or society in general. They may see it as a way to defy authority or feel like they are taking control of their own lives.</p>
<p>For some teenagers, gambling can also be seen as a way to make money. They may think that they can win big and quickly become rich. This can be a dangerous mentality, as most people who gamble lose money in the long run.</p>
<p>Gambling can also be addictive, and some teens may find themselves unable to resist the temptation to bet more and more money. This can lead to financial problems and even debt.</p>
<p>It is important for parents to talk with their children about the dangers of gambling and help them understand why it is not a wise decision to gamble online. Parents should also keep an eye on their children’s internet use, as many teenagers Gamble on websites without their parents even knowing.</p>
<h1 id="Is-There-a-Link-Between-Teenage-Depression-and-Gambling-Behavior"><a href="#Is-There-a-Link-Between-Teenage-Depression-and-Gambling-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Is There a Link Between Teenage Depression and Gambling Behavior?"></a>Is There a Link Between Teenage Depression and Gambling Behavior?</h1><p>A study recently published in the journal Pediatrics has found a link between teenage depression and gambling behavior.</p>
<p>The study looked at data from over 3,000 teenagers, and found that those who were depressed were more likely to gamble excessively.</p>
<p>Depression was defined as having symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, and low energy levels for two or more weeks.</p>
<p>Excessive gambling was defined as spending more than $50 per week on gambling activities.</p>
<p>The study found that around 20% of teenagers who were depressed also gambled excessively.</p>
<p>In contrast, only 5% of teenagers who were not depressed gambled excessively.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Sun Hee Lee, said that the findings highlight the importance of early identification and treatment of depression in teenagers.</p>
<p>“This study underscores the importance of screening for both depression and excessive gambling among adolescents,” she said. “Effective interventions are available to treat these problems.”</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that more research is needed to determine why there is a link between teenage depression and gambling behavior.</p>

The club decided to install some electronic roulette wheels in the North Stand as a way to raise money for the club. This has been a huge success with more than €2 million being raised in revenue since the start of the 2016-17 season.</p>
<p>This is a great way for the club to raise money, as it doesn’t put any extra financial pressure on the team. The fans seem to love it too, as it adds an extra bit of excitement to the game. It also makes it more interesting for the fans when they are betting on the game, as they can see how their team is performing and how their bets are doing at the same time.</p>
<p>The electronic roulette wheels have proven to be very popular with Schalke 04 fans, with many of them making regular visits to make a bet on the game. This is sure to continue for the foreseeable future, as the club looks to continue making money from gambling in their land!</p>
<h1 id="Schalke-04-make-gambling-history-in-their-land"><a href="#Schalke-04-make-gambling-history-in-their-land" class="headerlink" title="Schalke 04 make gambling history in their land!"></a>Schalke 04 make gambling history in their land!</h1><p>When FC Schalke 04 and VfL Wolfsburg met in the Bundesliga earlier this year, it made footballing history. Not because of any goals, cards or saves, but because the match was taking place in a casino!</p>
<p>This fixture marked the first time that a professional football match had ever been played in a gambling venue. And it was a momentous occasion for both clubs involved.</p>
<p>Schalke 04 are no strangers to using innovative methods to market themselves and attract new fans. In previous years, they have held matches at unusual venues such as a gas works and an old coal mine. So it’s not too surprising that they were keen to take part in this unique event.</p>
<p>As for Wolfsburg, they were no doubt excited about the opportunity to play in a casino environment. The club has a strong relationship with casinos, as their owner is the CEO of Germany’s largest gambling company, Gauselmann AG.</p>
<p>The match itself was played in front of around 1,000 spectators in the casino’s ballroom. And while it may not have been the most exciting game you’ll ever see, it was still an historic moment for German football.</p>

<p>The German club Schalke 04 have been in the news this week, as they have agreed a deal with Gumi Inc. which will see the gaming company become the main sponsor of the club. The agreement is reported to be worth in the region of €15 million per year, and will see Gumi Inc.’s logo feature on the front of Schalke’s shirts from next season.</p>
<p>This move has shocked many in the world of football, as it is relatively rare for a gambling company to become a main sponsor of a club. There are obvious concerns about how such a sponsorship might influence players, and whether or not they could be tempted to gamble excessively. However, Schalke 04 have defended their decision, insisting that they carried out a great deal of due diligence before agreeing to the deal.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this sponsorship arrangement works out, and whether or not it has a positive or negative impact on Schalke 04. There is no doubt that Gumi Inc. are hoping for some return on their investment, and they will be looking for Schalke 04 to achieve good results both domestically and in Europe.</p>
<h1 id="FC-Schalke-04-making-a-name-for-themselves-with-gambling-in-their-land"><a href="#FC-Schalke-04-making-a-name-for-themselves-with-gambling-in-their-land" class="headerlink" title="FC Schalke 04 making a name for themselves with gambling in their land!"></a>FC Schalke 04 making a name for themselves with gambling in their land!</h1><p>FC Schalke 04, a German based football club, is making headlines in the gambling world. With their new and innovative approach to gambling in their land, they are quickly making a name for themselves!</p>
<p>Schalke 04 was founded in 1904 and is one of the most successful clubs in Germany. They have won 9 German championships, 5 DFB-Pokals and 1 UEFA Cup. Their home ground is the Veltins-Arena, which has a seating capacity of 62,271 spectators.</p>
<p>The club’s staggering success in Germany is due, in part, to their impressive gambling strategies. For years, Schalke 04 has been using state-of-the-art technology to offer its fans a one-of-a-kind gambling experience. By incorporating cutting-edge features such as virtual reality and Augmented Reality into their games, Schalke 04 has set themselves apart from the competition.</p>
<p>And it’s not just Germans who are benefiting from this revolutionary approach to gambling! Thanks to Schalke 04’s online platform, fans all over the world can enjoy their exciting games from the comfort of their own homes. This allows people from all corners of the globe to experience the excitement of Bundesliga football first hand!</p>
<p>So far, Schalke 04’s gamble on gambling has paid off handsomely. Their innovative approach to the sport has helped them become one of the most popular clubs in Europe! And with continued success in the years ahead, there’s no doubt that Schalke 04 will continue to make a name for themselves in the world of gambling!</p>
<h1 id="Schalke-04-gamble-on-success-with-gambling-in-their-land"><a href="#Schalke-04-gamble-on-success-with-gambling-in-their-land" class="headerlink" title="Schalke 04 gamble on success with gambling in their land"></a>Schalke 04 gamble on success with gambling in their land</h1><p>After an unsuccessful season, Schalke 04 has decided to gamble on their success for the next Bundesliga season. The football club has announced that they have partnered with a German gambling company as their new main sponsor.</p>
<p>The Schalke 04 executive board believes that this new sponsorship will give the football club a competitive advantage going into the new season. Gambling is a very popular pastime in Germany and Schalke 04 is hoping to cash in on this.</p>
<p>The football club has not had the best of luck in recent years. They were unable to qualify for any European tournaments last season and they were also relegated from the German Cup. In order to turn things around, the Schalke 04 executive board has made some big changes.</p>
<p>One of these changes includes partnering with a German gambling company. This new sponsorship will give the football club €10 million per year for the next three seasons. In addition, the gambling company will get exclusive marketing rights for all of Schalke 04’s home games.</p>
<p>This new sponsorship is a risky move for the football club. Gambling is a very popular pastime in Germany, but it can also be quite risky. If Schalke 04 does not have a successful season, they could end up losing a lot of money.</p>
<p>Despite this risk, the Schalke 04 executive board believes that this is the right move for the club. They are hoping that this new partnership will help them achieve success in the Bundesliga and make them more competitive on a global scale.</p>

        <h1 id="Federal-government-authorizes-gambling-play-casino"><a href="#Federal-government-authorizes-gambling-play-casino" class="headerlink" title="Federal government authorizes gambling play casino"></a>Federal government authorizes gambling play casino</h1><p>The Department of Justice has rewritten the federal rules on internet gambling, a decision that could enable casino play and other games of chance over the internet.</p>
<p>The new rules, announced on Monday, will replace a 2011 opinion from the department’s criminal division that effectively made online gambling illegal. The 2011 ruling said that banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted for processing payments to illegal online gambling sites.</p>
<p>The new rules, which are scheduled to take effect in late June, will allow some types of online gambling but will still prohibit most Americans from playing casino games and betting on sports over the internet.</p>
<p>Under the new guidelines, states will be allowed to license and regulate some forms of internet gambling within their borders. But the rules will still prohibit most Americans from playing casino games and betting on sports over the internet. Financial institutions will also be allowed to process gambling payments, as long as those payments are not sent to unlicensed sites.</p>
<p>The rewrite is a victory for the American Gaming Association, a trade group that represents casinos, and for state governments that hope to collect taxes on internet gambling revenue. It is also a defeat for lawmakers who have argued that online gambling is addictive and risky for consumers.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement marks an important change in direction from the previous administration’s interpretation of the law,” said Bill McGlashan Jr., a venture capitalist who is co-founder of TPG Growth, which has invested in the Canadian online gaming company Stars Group Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>Monday’s announcement comes nearly two years after President Trump appointed Christopher A. Wray as head of the Justice Department. Mr. Wray had signaled his intention to reinterpret the 2011 opinion soon after he took office.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-authorizes-gambling-play-casino"><a href="#Nevada-authorizes-gambling-play-casino" class="headerlink" title="Nevada authorizes gambling play casino"></a>Nevada authorizes gambling play casino</h1><p>In February 2019, the Nevada state legislature authorized online gambling play for its casino industry. The vote was overwhelming, with only two dissenting voices in the Assembly, and now Nevada is the latest state to allow some form of internet gambling.</p>
<p>The new law allows casinos to partner with approved companies to offer real-money betting on poker, slots, and other games. The move is seen as a way to help the struggling casino industry in Nevada, where gambling revenue has been trending downward for years.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill raised concerns about underage gambling and addiction, but proponents argued that the new law would create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.</p>
<p>Now that Nevada has legalized online gambling, other states are likely to follow suit. This could mean big changes for the casino industry as a whole, and it will be interesting to see how things play out in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-tribes-authorize-gambling-play-casino"><a href="#Indian-tribes-authorize-gambling-play-casino" class="headerlink" title="Indian tribes authorize gambling play casino"></a>Indian tribes authorize gambling play casino</h1><p>The operations of Native American casinos are authorized by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. This law establishes the Indian Gaming Commission, which is tasked with regulating tribal gaming. Section 10 of the act prohibits casino gaming on lands acquired after October 17, 1988, with two exceptions. The first exception is for tribes that operate within states that expressly permit or license casino gaming. The second exception is for tribes that have a compact with the state in which their lands are located which permits casino gaming. In some cases, tribes operate casinos outside their reservation boundaries in states that do not expressly permit or license casino gaming. In these instances, the tribe is operating under the second exception and must have a compact with the state in order to do so.</p>
<p>The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that all revenue from gaming be used for tribal welfare, including education, health care, and infrastructure development. Tribes have used their gambling revenues to build schools, hospitals, and other needed infrastructure projects. Many tribes also use gambling revenues to fund programs that benefit their members, such as housing assistance and food services. Some tribes have even used their gambling revenues to finance litigation against state and federal governments.</p>

<p>“The authorization of gambling at the casino is an important step forward for our city,” said Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford. “It will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to our city.”</p>
<p>Atlantic City officials say they are also exploring other ways to stimulate the economy, including developing new tourism attractions and increasing business investment.</p>
<p>“We are committed to doing everything we can to help Atlantic City rebound from these tough economic times,” said Langford.</p>

<p>Play casino is a type of gambling that has become increasingly popular in recent years. It refers to the use of casino games to gamble, typically through the use of an online platform. This type of gambling is seen as being more convenient and less risky than traditional forms of gambling, such as betting on sports or playing poker in a physical casino.</p>
<p>The legalization of play casino in Canada is seen as a major victory for the gambling industry. It is expected to boost the revenues of online casinos in Canada and will likely lead to an increase in the number of people who gamble online. In addition, it is anticipated that the legalization of play casino will lead to the creation of new jobs in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about the legalization of play casino, however. Some opponents argue that it can be addictive and can lead to financial ruin for those who lose money gambling online. Others worry that it could be used by criminals to launder money or finance other illegal activities.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the majority of Canadians appear to support legalizing play casino. A poll conducted by Angus Reid last year found that 66% of Canadians were in favour of legalizing it. This suggests that the Canadian government made the right decision in authorizing gambling play casino.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Much-Do-You-Owe-In-Taxes-If-You-Win-Gambling"><a href="#How-Much-Do-You-Owe-In-Taxes-If-You-Win-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do You Owe In Taxes If You Win Gambling?"></a>How Much Do You Owe In Taxes If You Win Gambling?</h1><p>Some people might think that gambling is one of the best ways to make some extra money, but it can also lead to tax problems. If you are lucky enough to win a large amount of money from gambling, do you owe taxes on that money?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, you do owe taxes on gambling winnings. The amount of tax you owe depends on how much money you won and your overall taxable income. For example, if you have a taxable income of $50,000 and you win $2,000 from gambling, you would owe $200 in taxes on your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>However, there are some exceptions to the rule. If you gamble and lose money, you don’t have to report those losses on your tax return. This is because gambling losses are considered to be a form of personal expense. In addition, if you itemize your deductions on your tax return, you can deduct your gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>If you are not sure how much tax you owe on your gambling winnings, it is best to speak with a tax professional. They can help calculate the taxes you owe and make sure that you are paying the correct amount. As with any other type of income, it is important to report your gambling winnings accurately on your tax return so that you don’t end up owing penalties and interest later on.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Play-Casino-How-Much-Do-You-Owe-In-Taxes-If-You-Win"><a href="#Colorado-Play-Casino-How-Much-Do-You-Owe-In-Taxes-If-You-Win" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Play Casino: How Much Do You Owe In Taxes If You Win?"></a>Colorado Play Casino: How Much Do You Owe In Taxes If You Win?</h1><p>It’s the question on everyone’s mind when they go to gamble at the casino – how much do you have to pay in taxes if you win? </p>
<p>Of course, the answer depends on a variety of factors, including how much money you take home and your state of residence. Generally speaking though, you will owe income taxes on your winnings. However, there are some exceptions. For example, if you hit a jackpot worth over $5,000, the casino will withhold 24 percent for federal taxes. And depending on your state, you may also have to pay state taxes on your winnings. </p>
<p>If you’re unsure about how much you owe in taxes, it’s always best to consult with an accountant or tax specialist. They can help you navigate the complicated tax laws and ensure that you’re paying the right amount.</p>
<h1 id="What-Percent-Of-Winnings-Are-Taxed-In-Gambling"><a href="#What-Percent-Of-Winnings-Are-Taxed-In-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What Percent Of Winnings Are Taxed In Gambling?"></a>What Percent Of Winnings Are Taxed In Gambling?</h1><p>Gambling winnings are typically taxed at a rate of 25% for most types of gambling. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>Lottery winnings are taxed at a rate of 30%. Gambling Winnings from horse racing are also taxed at 30%. Games of skill, such as poker, blackjack or chess, are not taxed. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers these games to be entertainment and not as a form of gambling.</p>
<p>There are some other exceptions to the 25% rule. If you claim your gambling losses as itemized deductions on your taxes, you can deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. This is known as the “offset” method. So if you have $2,000 in winnings and $1,500 in losses, you would only pay taxes on the $500 difference.</p>
<p>There are also some ways to avoid paying taxes on your gambling winnings altogether. One way is to gamble online through an offshore site that is located in a country with no tax treaty with the United States. Be aware that this is considered illegal by the U.S. government and could result in fines or imprisonment if you are caught.</p>
<p>Another way to avoid paying taxes on your gambling winnings is to simply not report them to the IRS. This is obviously a risky proposition and could lead to audits or other penalties if you are caught. However, it is possible to get away with it if you keep your winnings under a certain amount each year ($5,000 or less).</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Calculate-Your-Winnings-For-Tax-Purposes"><a href="#How-To-Calculate-Your-Winnings-For-Tax-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="How To Calculate Your Winnings For Tax Purposes"></a>How To Calculate Your Winnings For Tax Purposes</h1><p>When you win money gambling, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants its share. The good news is that you can use a simple equation to calculate your winnings for tax purposes.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine your taxable income. This is the amount of money you earn from all sources minus any deductions you may have. Gambling income is included in this total.</p>
<p>Next, subtract your gambling losses from your gambling income. This will give you your net gambling income for the year.</p>
<p>Finally, multiply your net gambling income by the appropriate tax rate. The current rates are as follows:</p>
<p>• Single: 10%<br>• Married Filing Jointly: 10%<br>• Married Filing Separately: 25%<br>• Head of Household: 15%</p>
<h1 id="Are-Winnings-From-Gambling-Taxable-In-Colorado"><a href="#Are-Winnings-From-Gambling-Taxable-In-Colorado" class="headerlink" title="Are Winnings From Gambling Taxable In Colorado?"></a>Are Winnings From Gambling Taxable In Colorado?</h1><p>The short answer to this question is yes, gambling winnings are taxable in Colorado. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, if you win less than $600, the winnings are not taxable. Additionally, if you lose money gambling, that loss can be deducted from your taxable gambling income.</p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to gambling and taxes in Colorado. First of all, you are required to report your gambling winnings on your tax return. Additionally, you may have to pay taxes on any prizes or awards you receive from gambling.</p>
<p>If you have questions about whether or not your gambling income is taxable in Colorado, it is best to speak with an accountant or tax specialist.</p>

        <h1 id="Vegas-Casino-Heist-Nets-6M-in-Winnings"><a href="#Vegas-Casino-Heist-Nets-6M-in-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Casino Heist Nets $6M in Winnings!"></a>Vegas Casino Heist Nets $6M in Winnings!</h1><p>The heist that many in the Vegas casino community are still talking about happened a little over a week ago, on the night of July 29th. At around 10pm, four masked men walked into the Bellagio Casino and headed for the high-roller section. They had apparently cased the joint and knew where they were going.</p>
<p> Without warning, they pulled out handguns and began yelling at everyone to get down. One of the waitstaff was in the process of serving drinks to some high rollers when he was ordered to get down on the floor. He complied, but not before reaching for the panic button under the bar.</p>
<p>The gunmen then proceeded to rob several of the high-rollers at gunpoint, making off with over $6 million in winnings. They fled the scene in a black SUV that had been waiting for them outside.</p>
<p>Police are still investigating and have released very few details about the robbery. No one has been arrested and no suspects have been identified. The only thing that is known for sure is that those responsible are extremely skilled at what they do and planned this robbery very carefully.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a major casino heist has taken place in Vegas. In 2010, two men walked into the Aria Casino and stole nearly $1 million from the high-roller area. And just last year, three men robbed Caesar’s Palace of more than $1 million. So while it may be alarming that this is becoming more common, it’s not exactly unheard of either.</p>
<p>Casinos have been beefing up security measures in recent years in an attempt to prevent these types of robberies, but clearly they are not foolproof. It will be interesting to see if any additional security measures are put into place in light of this latest robbery, or if casinos just have to accept that this is something that could happen from time to time.</p>
<p>In either case, it’s clear that those responsible for robbing the Bellagio Casino know what they’re doing and are very lucky (or skilled) enough to have walked away with over $6 million in cash.</p>

The suspect, armed with a handgun, made off with over $1.5 million in cash and casino chips.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the Bellagio has been targeted by thieves; in fact, it’s one of the most commonly robbed casinos in the world. In 2010, an armed man made off with over $1 million in chips, and in 2012, a group of men robbed the casino of more than $40,000 worth of cash and chips.</p>
<p>The latest robbery is still under investigation, but police have released a description of the suspect. He is said to be a white male in his mid-20s, approximately 6’0” tall and 150 lbs. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, black pants and a black ski mask.</p>
<p>If you have any information about this crime or the identity of the suspect, please contact Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.</p>

He was last seen wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and white sneakers.</p>
<p>The Casino Robbery Unit is asking for the public’s help in identifying a suspect who robbed the Lady Luck Casino at gunpoint on Thursday, January 31, 2019.</p>
<p>At approximately 2:15 a.m., the suspect entered the casino and approached a female employee at the cashier’s cage. He pointed a handgun at her and demanded money. The victim complied and the suspect fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash.</p>
<p>No one was injured in this incident.</p>
<p>The Casino Robbery Unit is asking anyone with information about this incident to contact them at 702-828-3591 or Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.</p>

The thieves stole an undisclosed amount of money from the casino’s cashier cage.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made and the FBI is asking for the public’s help in identifying the suspects.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Bellagio has been targeted by thieves. In 2010, a group of men robbed the casino of more than $1 million dollars.</p>
<p>The FBI released surveillance footage of the latest robbery and asked anyone with information about the suspects to contact them.</p>
<h1 id="Man-Charged-in-1-5M-Casino-Heist"><a href="#Man-Charged-in-1-5M-Casino-Heist" class="headerlink" title="Man Charged in $1.5M Casino Heist"></a>Man Charged in $1.5M Casino Heist</h1><p>A 30-year-old man has been charged in a $1.5 million casino heist earlier this year.</p>
<p>According to the criminal complaint, the man entered the casino on January 15th, 2018, and went to the high-limit gaming area. There, he approached a blackjack table and asked the dealer for $5,000 in chips. The dealer turned over the chips, and the man fled the scene.</p>
<p>Surveillance footage from the casino showed that the man had also stolen chips from two other tables before fleeing.</p>
<p>The man was arrested last week and has been charged with third-degree robbery. If convicted, he could face up to seven years in prison.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has been robbed in this manner. In fact, this type of robbery is becoming increasingly common as thieves target small amounts of cash from casinos rather than trying to rob armored cars or banks.</p>
<p>In order to combat this type of theft, many casinos are now using chip readers that can detect if a chip has been stolen. This has helped to reduce the number of chip thefts at casinos, but it has not stopped them altogether.</p>

        <h1 id="BETTING-ON-SPORTS-LEGAL-IN-TENNESSEE"><a href="#BETTING-ON-SPORTS-LEGAL-IN-TENNESSEE" class="headerlink" title="BETTING ON SPORTS LEGAL IN TENNESSEE"></a>BETTING ON SPORTS LEGAL IN TENNESSEE</h1><p>In March of 2018, the state of Tennessee legalized betting on sports. This was a momentous occasion, as it made Tennessee the first state in the southeastern United States to allow this type of gambling. This new law will allow Tennesseans to place bets on sporting events both within the state and outside of it. The state has been working on this legislation for a number of years, and it is finally coming to fruition.</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits that come with legalized sports betting. First and foremost, it will generate revenue for the state government. In addition, it will create jobs, as there will be a need for people to work in the sports betting industry. Finally, it will give people a chance to make some money by betting on their favorite teams.</p>
<p>There are some risks associated with sports betting, however. The biggest risk is that people will lose money by gambling on sports. Additionally, there is always the possibility that someone will cheat in order to win bets. Finally, if sports betting becomes too popular, it could lead to problems such as addiction and corruption.</p>
<p>Despite these risks, I believe that the benefits of legalized sports betting outweigh them. I am excited to see how this new law plays out and I am hopeful that it will be a success.</p>
<h1 id="NEW-JERSEY-CASINOS-OFFERING-ONLINE-GAMBLING"><a href="#NEW-JERSEY-CASINOS-OFFERING-ONLINE-GAMBLING" class="headerlink" title="NEW JERSEY CASINOS OFFERING ONLINE GAMBLING"></a>NEW JERSEY CASINOS OFFERING ONLINE GAMBLING</h1><p>In order to make up for slow sales at physical casinos, a number of New Jersey casino operators have started offering online gambling. This includes Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, Ocean Resort Casino, Resorts Casino Hotel, and Tropicana Casino and Resort.</p>
<p>The Borgata was the first casino in Atlantic City to offer online gambling and has seen success since its launch in November 2013. Players can access the casino’s website on their computer or mobile device and gamble on games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget also offers online gambling and is one of the few casinos in New Jersey to offer live dealer games. These are games where players can watch dealers live from a studio through a video feed and interact with them just as they would in a physical casino.</p>
<p>“We’re extremely happy with the results we’ve seen from our online casino,” said Rummy Pandit, senior vice president of digital gaming for Golden Nugget. “The product offering is resonating well with customers, driving solid growth in visitation and spend.”</p>
<p>Ocean Resort Casino is another newcomer to the online gambling scene. It launched its site in early June 2018 with a selection of slots and table games. The site offers both real-money and play-money options, giving players the chance to practise before betting real money.</p>
<p>Resorts Casino Hotel was the second Atlantic City casino to launch an online gambling site. It went live in February 2018 with a range of slots, table games, and poker variants. Like Ocean Resort Casino, Resorts offers both real-money and play-money modes so that players can practise before betting actual money.</p>
<p>Tropicana Casino and Resort is the most recent Atlantic City casino to launch an online gambling site. It soft-launched its site in late May 2018 with a limited selection of slots and table games. The full range of games will be available at launch on June 18th, 2018.</p>

The game will offer players the chance to win up to $100,000 on a single ticket.</p>
<p>“Keno is an exciting addition to our lineup of games,” said Nevada Lottery Director Alice disposable income. “We think players will enjoy the chance to win big prizes on a single ticket.”</p>
<p>To play, players select up to 10 numbers from 1-80. Twenty numbers are then drawn at random and players who match at least four numbers win prizes ranging from $2 to $100,000. Tickets cost $1 each.</p>
<p>Keno will join other popular Nevada Lottery games such as Powerball, Mega Millions and Hot Lotto. Players can purchase tickets online or at more than 650 retailers across the state.</p>
<p>Since the Nevada Lottery was founded in 1988, it has generated more than $5 billion in proceeds for public education programs in the state.

This ruling overturns a state law that made it illegal to play poker.</p>
<p>The case was brought to court by three men who were charged with playing poker in a private home. The men argued that poker is a game of skill and not chance, and the court agreed. This ruling opens the door for poker players in Wisconsin to organize tournaments and leagues without the fear of being arrested.</p>
<p>This ruling is good news for the poker community in Wisconsin, as well as for players nationwide. It establishes once and for all that poker is a legitimate game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.</p>
<h1 id="IOWANS-BACK-LEGALIZATION-OF-CASINO-GAMBLING"><a href="#IOWANS-BACK-LEGALIZATION-OF-CASINO-GAMBLING" class="headerlink" title="IOWANS BACK LEGALIZATION OF CASINO GAMBLING"></a>IOWANS BACK LEGALIZATION OF CASINO GAMBLING</h1><p>A recent poll of Iowa residents found that a majority back the legalization of casino gambling in the state. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed said they supported legalizing casinos, while 29 percent were opposed and 10 percent were undecided.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by Selzer and Company for the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics. It included telephone interviews with 802 Iowa adults from Feb. 23-26.</p>
<p>Legalization of casinos has been debated in the Iowa Legislature in recent years, but has not progressed very far. Republican Gov. Terry Branstad has said he does not support legalizing casinos.</p>
<p> Democratic lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow casino gambling at three sites in the state, including one each in Sioux City, Dubuque and Cedar Rapids. Under the proposal, the state would get a percentage of casino profits.</p>
<p>Iowa is one of six states that does not have legalized casino gambling. The other states are Hawaii, Utah, Nebraska, Mississippi and Alabama.</p>
