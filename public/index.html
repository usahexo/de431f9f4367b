        <h1 id="Bingo-Written-in-the-Mid-1800s"><a href="#Bingo-Written-in-the-Mid-1800s" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Written in the Mid 1800s!"></a>Bingo Written in the Mid 1800s!</h1><p>The game of bingo is said to have originated in Italy in the 1500s, where it was known as Beano. In England, the game was played using beans instead of balls, hence the name Beano. When British soldiers travelled to America during World War II, they brought the game with them. It eventually caught on with American civilians and morphed into the bingo we know today.</p>
<p>Bingo is a relatively simple game to play. In most variants, players are given a card with a number grid and 24 different spaces. Fifteen of these spaces are numbered 1 through 15 and the other nine are lettered B-I-N-G-O. The numbers are called out one at a time and players cover the corresponding squares on their cards with markers. The first player to cover all of their squares wins the game.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to play bingo, but the most popular variant is called 75 ball bingo. In this version, players are given five rows of five squares each. The numbers are drawn from a pool of 75 balls numbered 1 through 75. Players can mark off their squares in any order they like and must daub (or mark) them off with a vertical line. The first player to mark off all their squares and call out “Bingo!” wins the game.</p>
<p>Bingo can be played by anyone, regardless of age or experience level. It’s a great way for families to spend time together and it’s perfect for social gatherings or parties. There are also many online versions of bingo that allow players from all over the world to compete against each other.</p>
<h1 id="The-Song-Bingo-was-Originally-Composed-by-an-Unkown-Musician"><a href="#The-Song-Bingo-was-Originally-Composed-by-an-Unkown-Musician" class="headerlink" title="The Song Bingo was Originally Composed by an Unkown Musician!"></a>The Song Bingo was Originally Composed by an Unkown Musician!</h1><p>The Song Bingo, a popular game that is now widely played in Asia and North America, was originally composed by an unknown musician. The game was created in the 1970s and became very popular throughout Asia during the early 1980s. In fact, there are many variations of the Song Bingo game that have been developed over the years. However, the basic premise of the game is to identify songs based on lyrics that are called out by the game host.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a resurgence in popularity for Song Bingo games in North America. This can likely be attributed to the fact that the game is relatively easy to learn and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. In addition, because most people are familiar with at least some popular songs, it is generally easy to guess which song is being referenced when lyrics are called out.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways that Song Bingo games can be played. One popular variation is to play as teams where each team tries to identify songs based on clues given by the game host. Another variation is to play as individuals where players attempt to identify songs based on their own knowledge. Lastly, some games allow players to use their smartphones or other devices to look up song titles online if they are unsure of the answer.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a fan of music or just looking for a fun and challenging new game to play with your friends, Song Bingo is definitely worth checking out!</p>
<h1 id="Who-Wrote-the-Song-Bingo"><a href="#Who-Wrote-the-Song-Bingo" class="headerlink" title="Who Wrote the Song Bingo?"></a>Who Wrote the Song Bingo?</h1><p>The song Bingo is a popular children’s game that is believed to have been created in the early 1800s. There are many theories about who actually wrote the song, but no one can be sure. One popular theory is that it was written by an anonymous author, possibly a schoolteacher.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the song was written by Sir Henry Jones, an English musician and composer. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>The most likely explanation is that the song was collaboration between multiple authors. It is possible that different versions of the song were created in different parts of the world and that they eventually merged together to form the version that we know today.</p>
<p> regardless of who wrote it, Bingo remains a popular children’s game that is enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
<h1 id="A-Poker-Room-Classic-Bingo"><a href="#A-Poker-Room-Classic-Bingo" class="headerlink" title="A Poker Room Classic - Bingo!"></a>A Poker Room Classic - Bingo!</h1><p>There’s something about a bingo hall that just feels classic. Maybe it’s the cheap cards and markers, or the anticipation as the caller slowly reads off the numbers. Whatever it is, there’s just something special about playing bingo.</p>
<p>Today, there are plenty of ways to play bingo. The traditional way is to go to a hall, but now you can also play online. And there are even apps for your phone or tablet. So no matter where you are, you can enjoy a game of bingo.</p>
<p>The basic rules of bingo are pretty easy to learn. You get five random numbers called out, and then you mark those numbers on your card. If you have all five numbers called, you win! The tricky part is trying to figure out which number will be called next.</p>
<p>One thing that makes bingo fun is the social aspect. It’s always more fun to play with friends, and many halls have special games and prizes for teams or groups. So if you want to have some laughs and maybe win some money too, give bingo a try!</p>
<h1 id="The-History-of-the-song-Bingo"><a href="#The-History-of-the-song-Bingo" class="headerlink" title="The History of the song Bingo"></a>The History of the song Bingo</h1><p>Bingo is a game that has been around for centuries and has a very colorful history. The exact origin of the game is unknown, but it is thought to have originated in Italy in the 16th century. From there, it spread to France and then to Germany, where it became extremely popular. In fact, bingo was so popular in Germany that the government tried to ban it!</p>
<p>The popularity of bingo continued to grow, and in 1929, it came to the United States. It was first played in New York City, and quickly became popular across the country. In fact, during World War II, American soldiers stationed in Europe would play bingo to pass the time.</p>
<p>Today, bingo is still enjoyed by millions of people around the world. It’s a fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and there’s always something exciting happening at a bingo hall. If you’ve never played bingo before, be sure to give it a try – you might just fall in love with this classic game!</p>

        <h1 id="Surrendering-fingers-could-lead-to-better-blackjack-strategy"><a href="#Surrendering-fingers-could-lead-to-better-blackjack-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Surrendering fingers could lead to better blackjack strategy!"></a>Surrendering fingers could lead to better blackjack strategy!</h1><p>It has long been known that surrendering fingers can give you a better blackjack strategy. By removing some of your fingers, you can decrease the number of cards in your hand, which will improve your odds of winning.</p>
<p>There are many ways to go about surrendering fingers. Some people choose to cut off their fingers entirely, while others simply remove a small portion of each finger. The most important thing is to make sure that you surrender enough fingers to make a difference.</p>
<p>Some people choose to only remove two or three fingers, but this may not be enough to make a real impact on your strategy. If you want to improve your odds of winning, it is important to remove enough fingers so that you have fewer cards in total.</p>
<p>Many experts recommend removing at least four or five fingers. This will help you reduce the number of cards in your hand and give you a better chance of winning. It is also important to remember that the more fingers you remove, the greater the impact on your strategy will be.</p>
<p>So if you’re serious about improving your blackjack odds, consider surrendering some of your fingers!</p>
<h1 id="The-benefits-of-surrendering-fingers-during-blackjack-gameplay"><a href="#The-benefits-of-surrendering-fingers-during-blackjack-gameplay" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of surrendering fingers during blackjack gameplay!"></a>The benefits of surrendering fingers during blackjack gameplay!</h1><p>Giving up fingers during blackjack gameplay might seem like a crazy proposition, but if you are looking to maximize your chances of winning then it is something that you should definitely consider.</p>
<p>When you surrender fingers during blackjack, you are giving up the chance to win back any money that has been lost on previous hands. However, by doing this you are also lowering the house edge and increasing your chances of walking away with a profit.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to surrender fingers during blackjack. Firstly, you need to make sure that the casino allows players to surrender fingers. Not all casinos offer this option, so be sure to check before sitting down at the table.</p>
<p>Secondly, you need to be comfortable with the idea of giving up potential wins. If you are someone who likes to go all in on every hand then surrendering fingers may not be for you. However, if you are happy to play for smaller profits then this strategy could definitely work in your favour.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is important to remember that surrendering fingers will not always be the best decision. Sometimes it is better to take a chance and try to win back money that has been lost than to simply fold and walk away with nothing. So use this strategy sparingly and only when you feel confident that it is the right move for you.</p>
<p>Overall, surrendering fingers can be a very effective way of improving your chances of winning at blackjack. Just make sure that you weigh up all of the pros and cons before making a decision, and be prepared to accept the occasional loss as part of the game.</p>
<h1 id="Should-you-surrender-your-fingers-while-playing-blackjack"><a href="#Should-you-surrender-your-fingers-while-playing-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Should you surrender your fingers while playing blackjack?"></a>Should you surrender your fingers while playing blackjack?</h1><p>Many people play blackjack in order to try their luck and win some money. However, there are a few things that you should know in order to make the most of your game and increase your chances of winning. One such thing is when to surrender your fingers.</p>
<p>Surrendering your fingers means forfeiting half of your bet and giving up your hand. This can be a good option under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you have a 16 or lower and the dealer has an Ace, then you should surrender because the dealer is likely to get a Blackjack (a hand totaling 21).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have two cards of the same value, for example two eights, then you should surrender. This is because the odds of getting another card that will make 21 are low, so it is best to forfeit half of your bet and save yourself some money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the dealer has a 3, 4, 5 or 6 as their up card and you have two cards of those values, then you should also surrender. This is because the dealer is likely to get a blackjack if they draw another card.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Finger-surrender-may-be-key-to-winning-at-blackjack"><a href="#Finger-surrender-may-be-key-to-winning-at-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Finger surrender may be key to winning at blackjack!"></a>Finger surrender may be key to winning at blackjack!</h1><p>Casinos around the world make billions of dollars in profits each year. This is because they have a number of games that give them an edge over the players. One such game is blackjack. However, there are ways for players to increase their chances of winning at blackjack. One such way is by surrendering their fingers!</p>
<p>When playing blackjack, a player has the option of surrendering their hand if they believe that they are not going to win. In other words, they can give up their hand and receive half of their original bet back. This option is not available to all players though. It is only available to those who are playing with two cards and have a total value of less than ten.</p>
<p>Surrendering one’s fingers when playing blackjack may seem like a strange thing to do, but it can actually be a very effective strategy. When you consider that the casino has an edge of around 2%, surrendering your fingers can help you reduce this edge to around 1%. This may not seem like a lot, but it can make a big difference over the long run.</p>
<p>So, next time you are playing blackjack, consider surrendering your fingers!</p>
<h1 id="Are-you-sacrificing-your-chances-of-winning-at-blackjack-by-not-surrendering-your-fingers"><a href="#Are-you-sacrificing-your-chances-of-winning-at-blackjack-by-not-surrendering-your-fingers" class="headerlink" title="Are you sacrificing your chances of winning at blackjack by not surrendering your fingers?"></a>Are you sacrificing your chances of winning at blackjack by not surrendering your fingers?</h1><p>In blackjack, as with most casino games, you’re trying to beat the dealer. With a little bit of luck and some sound betting strategy, you can walk away a winner more often than not. But are you sacrificing your chances of winning by not surrendering your fingers?</p>
<p>There is a lot of debate on the merits of surrendering in blackjack. Some people swear by it as a sound strategy, while others think it’s nothing more than a waste of time. So what’s the truth? Is surrendering worth your time or should you stick to basic strategy and leave it at that?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we need to take a look at the basics of blackjack surrender. When you surrender in blackjack, you forfeit half of your bet and give up your hand. This can be a good move if you have a poor hand and the dealer is showing an ace or face card. In those situations, you’re better off cutting your losses and walking away.</p>
<p>But there are other times when surrendering is not such a good idea. If you have a strong hand, for example, surrendering is usually not worth it. You’re much better off trying to beat the dealer outright rather than giving up half your bet.</p>
<p>So when should you surrender in blackjack? The answer depends on the specifics of each situation. But as a general rule, if you have a weak hand and the dealer is showing an advantageous card, then surrendering is a good option. If you have a strong hand, however, there’s no reason to give up so easily – stick to basic strategy and go for the win!</p>

Dancing drums slot machines heading to Arizona!"></a>Arizona governor vetoes bill that would have allowed dancing drums slot machines in the state.2. Dancing drums slot machines heading to Arizona!</h1><ol>
<li><p>After much deliberation, Arizona governor Doug Ducey vetoed a bill on Monday that would have allowed dancing drums slot machines in the state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The veto comes as a bit of a surprise, as the Republican governor had previously said he was undecided on the issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“This is not an about whether or not I like gambling,” Ducey said in a statement after vetoing the bill. “I don’t.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“It’s about giving the people of Arizona a voice and a choice.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>The dancing drums slot machines are essentially electronic bingo games that are played to music. They were approved by the Arizona Department of Gaming last year and have been a big hit in other states where they are available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Opponents of the machines say they are too addictive and lead to gambling addiction problems. Supporters argue that they are no different than other casino games and are simply a form of entertainment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the bill had been signed into law, dancing drums slot machines would have been available at casinos across the state starting in July.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Arizona officials approve dancing drums slot machines for bars and casinos.4. Dancing drums slot machine ban overturned in Arizona!</h1><p>Arizona officials have approved the use of dancing drums slot machines in bars and casinos. This comes after a ban on the machines was overturned in February.</p>
<p>The reversal of the ban comes after State Senator Sonny Borrelli introduced a bill that would allow counties to approve the machines for use in their establishments. The bill was approved by the Senate and then signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey.</p>
<p>Dancing drums are electronic slot machines that feature animated characters that play drums. The machines became popular in Asia and Europe and have been growing in popularity in the United States over the past few years.</p>
<h1 id="5-Arizona-sees-first-dancing-drums-slot-machine-at-tribal-casino"><a href="#5-Arizona-sees-first-dancing-drums-slot-machine-at-tribal-casino" class="headerlink" title="5. Arizona sees first dancing drums slot machine at tribal casino."></a>5. Arizona sees first dancing drums slot machine at tribal casino.</h1><p>The San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona has debuted the first dancing drums slot machine at its casino, the Apache Nugget.</p>
<p>The new machine offers players a unique experience, with animations of two traditional Native American dancers striking drums in time to the music. The aim of the game is to match symbols on the screen with those that appear on the drums, creating winning combinations.</p>
<p>The machine was designed in consultation with tribal elders, who helped to choose the songs and dances that would feature in it. Chairman Terry Rambler said: “Our elders have been very involved in the development of this game, to ensure that it preserves our cultural heritage while providing a fun and entertaining gaming experience for our members.”</p>
<p>The Apache Nugget is located on the San Carlos Apache reservation near Globe, Arizona. It opened in March 2016 and features more than 400 electronic gaming machines.</p>

Different machines have different payout rates, so it’s important that you find the right one for you. Here are a few tips on how to choose the right slot machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look for machines with high payouts. The higher the payout percentage, the more money you stand to win.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check the number of coins required to activate the jackpot. If you don’t have enough coins, you won’t be able to win the jackpot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play at casinos that offer good bonus programs. This will give you extra money to play with and increase your chances of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for machines with high hit frequencies. This means that the machine pays out more often, giving you more chances to win.</p>

They are easy to play and can be very lucrative. However, not all slot machines are the same. Some are better suited for certain players than others. So, how do you choose the right slot machine for you?</p>
<p>The first thing you need to consider is your budget. How much money are you willing to spend on a slot machine? There are slot machines for every budget, so find one that fits your needs.</p>
<p>Next, think about your playing style. What type of player are you? If you like to play fast and loose, then go for a slot machine with a high payout percentage. If you like to take your time and strategize, then look for a machine with more bonus features.</p>
<p>Finally, consider your preferences. Do you like loud music and flashing lights? Or do you prefer a quieter experience? Slot machines come in all shapes and sizes, so find one that suits your taste.</p>
<p>Once you’ve considered these factors, it’s time to find the right slot machine for you! Start by visiting your nearest casino or online casino and checking out their selection of slot machines. Try out a few different ones until you find one that’s perfect for you. Good luck!</p>
<h1 id="Understanding-Slot-Machines-for-Bingo"><a href="#Understanding-Slot-Machines-for-Bingo" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Slot Machines for Bingo"></a>Understanding Slot Machines for Bingo</h1><p>Slot machines are likely the first thing that come to mind when thinking of bingo halls and casinos. Slot machines are popular among casino-goers, and there’s a good reason for that. They’re exciting, offer a wide range of betting options, and have the potential to pay out big money.</p>
<p>But slot machines can be confusing for first time casino-goers. If you’re new to slots or just want to learn more about them, this guide is for you. We’ll cover the different types of slot machines, how they work, and some tips on how to play them.</p>
<p>Types of Slot Machines</p>
<p>There are a few different types of slot machines: three-reel slots, five-reel slots, progressive slots, bonus slots, and video slots. Three-reel slots are the simplest type of slot machine. They have three spinning reels with symbols on them. The goal is to match three symbols in a row to win a prize. Five-reel slots are more complex than three-reel slots and have five spinning reels with symbols on them. The goal is still to match three symbols in a row to win a prize, but there are also bonus rounds and other features that can increase your chances of winning. Progressive slots are the most complex type of slot machine. They have multiple spinning reels like five-reel slots, but the jackpot grows with every spin—no matter what game you’re playing! Bonus slots are similar to five-reel slots, but they have special bonus rounds that can give you extra prizes or even free spins. Video slots are the most popular type of slot machine and look more like traditional video games than traditional slot machines. They typically have five spinning reels with multiple paylines (ways to win).</p>
<p>How Slot Machines Work</p>
<p>Slot machines work by reading data from a computer chip called a “random number generator” (RNG). This chip determines the outcome of each spin by spitting out a series of random numbers. The “random number generator” is completely fair and impartial—it doesn’t know whether you’ve bet $1 or $100! This is why it’s important not to let yourself get too wrapped up in the excitement of playing; if you start getting superstitious or making bets based on previous results, you’ll quickly lose money.</p>
<p>Tips for Playing Slot Machines</p>
<p>Now that you know how slot machines work, here are some tips for playing them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t gamble more than you’re comfortable losing - Slot machines can be addictive and before you know it you’ve blown your budget for the night&#x2F;week&#x2F;month etc so set yourself some ground rules beforehand on what amount you’re willing to spend whilst enjoying yourself gambling . </li>
<li>Try varying your bets - You don’t always have to bet max bet especially if the game offers smaller but consistent wins rather than waiting for that one lucky big payout which may never come .    3) Use bonuses wisely - Most casinos will offer sign up bonuses as an incentive however make sure not to blow your whole bankroll before playing any games by using it all on matched deposit bonuses etc , leave some in reserve so you still have something to play with when those higher variance games come up !</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-slot-machines-work-for-bingo"><a href="#How-slot-machines-work-for-bingo" class="headerlink" title="How slot machines work for bingo"></a>How slot machines work for bingo</h1><p>The slot machines are one of the most famous and widely used casino games. The slots work on a Random Number Generator (RNG) that ensures all the players have the same chances of winning, regardless of when they play. Here is how it works:</p>
<p>When you start playing, the RNG generates a number. This number corresponds to one of the symbols on the reel. The reels then spin and eventually stop on that symbol. If that symbol matches the one that was generated by the RNG, you win!</p>
<p>There are different types of slot machines out there and each one has its own RNG. However, the basic workings of all slot machines are more or less the same.</p>

But how will this growth impact the industry as a whole? And what are the benefits of mobile sports betting for players?</p>
<p>The Benefits of Mobile Sports Betting</p>
<p>There are many benefits to mobile sports betting. For starters, it’s convenient – you can place bets from anywhere at any time. And since most mobile sportsbooks offer live betting, you can bet on games as they’re happening. This adds an extra layer of excitement to the game.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that mobile sportsbooks typically have better odds than land-based casinos. Plus, they offer a wider variety of bets, so you can find the bet that’s right for you. And because there’s no need to leave your home, you can save time and money on transportation costs.</p>
<p>How Mobile Sports Betting Will Impact the Industry</p>
<p>Mobile sports betting is rapidly growing in popularity, and it’s poised to have a big impact on the industry. In fact, according to a study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, LLC., by 2021 over half of all sports bets will be placed through mobile devices.</p>
<p>This growth is largely due to the convenience and flexibility that mobile sports betting offers players. With more states legalizing it, more people are able to take advantage of its benefits. And as more people start using mobile sportsbooks, the industry will continue to grow.</p>
<p>This growth is good news for players, as it means they’ll have access to better odds and a wider variety of bets. It also means that they can place bets anytime and anywhere – which adds an extra layer of excitement to the game.</p>
<h1 id="Finally-Legalized-Mobile-Sports-Betting-Across-Selected-U-S-States"><a href="#Finally-Legalized-Mobile-Sports-Betting-Across-Selected-U-S-States" class="headerlink" title="Finally, Legalized Mobile Sports Betting Across Selected U.S. States"></a>Finally, Legalized Mobile Sports Betting Across Selected U.S. States</h1><p>In May of 2018, the United States Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in favor of legalized sports betting across the nation. The decision effectively overturned a 1992 federal law that had banned single-game sports wagers in every state but Nevada.</p>
<p>Naturally, this created a flurry of activity among states to develop legislation and regulations to allow for such gambling within their borders. And while some have been more aggressive than others in getting things up and running, there is now a slowly growing patchwork of legal sports betting in the United States.</p>
<p>Alaska, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, and West Virginia were among the first states to legalize mobile sports betting after the SCOTUS ruling. More recently, Pennsylvania followed suit, as did Rhode Island and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Hawaii may be next in line – lawmakers there are currently considering a bill that would legalize wagers both online and through retail sports books. And Oklahoma is also eyeing legalization after seeing how much revenue other states are bringing in from sports betting taxes.</p>
<p>So just how big has this market become? According to Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming research, states with legalized sports betting will bring in an estimated $8 billion in bets this year alone. That number is expected to grow to $16 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>A big part of that growth will come from increasing legalization of mobile betting. In fact, it’s projected that over 60% of all sports betting activity will take place online by 2023. This burgeoning market is ripe for investment, so if you’re looking for some promising opportunities in the space, look no further!</p>
<h1 id="Which-States-Allow-Mobile-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Which-States-Allow-Mobile-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Which States Allow Mobile Sports Betting?"></a>Which States Allow Mobile Sports Betting?</h1><p>As sports betting continues to gain in popularity, more and more states are starting to legalize it. This is great news for those who love to place bets on their favorite teams, as it means that they can now do so from anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of states allow mobile sports betting, but that number is expected to grow in the coming years. Let’s take a look at which states currently allow it, and how you can go about placing bets from your phone or tablet.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware"><a href="#Delaware" class="headerlink" title="Delaware"></a>Delaware</h1><p>Delaware was one of the first states to legalize sports betting, and it currently has the most liberal laws when it comes to mobile wagering. As long as you are physically located within state lines, you are allowed to place bets using your phone or tablet.</p>
<p>There are several apps available that allow residents of Delaware to bet on sports, including DraftKings and BetStars. You can also place bets through the websites of local casinos like Caesar’s Palace and Dover Downs.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey"><a href="#New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey"></a>New Jersey</h1><p>New Jersey was one of the first states to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court decision in 2018. In addition to traditional sports betting options at land-based casinos, New Jersey also offers mobile betting through its app, NJ Sportsbook.</p>
<p>You can download the NJ Sportsbook app for free on both Android and iOS devices. Once you have registered for an account, you can start placing bets on all your favorite teams. The app offers live odds and point spreads, as well as in-game wagering opportunities.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia"><a href="#West-Virginia" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia"></a>West Virginia</h1><p>West Virginia became the third state in the US to offer legal sports betting after the Supreme Court ruling in 2018. There are currently two land-based casinos in West Virginia that offer sports betting services: The Greenbrier Resort and Mountaineer Casino Racetrack &amp; Resort.</p>
<p>However, only The Greenbrier Resort offers mobile betting services at this time. You can download the The Greenbrier app for free on Android and iOS devices, and start placing bets on all your favorite teams right from your phone or tablet.</p>

        <h1 id="Prince-Hans-Adam-II-to-Turn-Stone-Casino-for-First-Time-in-45-Years"><a href="#Prince-Hans-Adam-II-to-Turn-Stone-Casino-for-First-Time-in-45-Years" class="headerlink" title="Prince Hans-Adam II to Turn Stone Casino for First Time in 45 Years"></a>Prince Hans-Adam II to Turn Stone Casino for First Time in 45 Years</h1><p>Prince Hans-Adam II, the long reigning monarch of Liechtenstein, is set to turn the casino in his principality for the first time in 45 years this weekend.</p>
<p>The 64-year-old prince is a known gambler, and is expected to place some high-stakes bets at the table games inside the Stone Casino.</p>
<p>“This will be a special occasion for the Prince,” said a spokesperson for Hans-Adam. “He has not visited the casino since he was 19 years old.”</p>
<p>Hans-Adam’s father, Franz Joseph II, opened the casino in 1971. The younger prince took over as ruler of Liechtenstein following his father’s death in 1989.</p>
<p>The casino is open daily from 10am to 2am, and features blackjack, roulette and poker tables.</p>
<h1 id="How-Old-Do-You-Have-to-Be-to-Gamble-at-Turn-Stone-Casino"><a href="#How-Old-Do-You-Have-to-Be-to-Gamble-at-Turn-Stone-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Old Do You Have to Be to Gamble at Turn Stone Casino?"></a>How Old Do You Have to Be to Gamble at Turn Stone Casino?</h1><p>If you are looking to gamble at the Turn Stone Casino, you must be at least 21 years old. This is because the casino follows the New York State law which states that anyone who is 21 or older can gamble in a casino.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule, however. If you are visiting the casino from another country and are over the age of 18, you will be able to gamble at the casino. There are also some special events at the casino where people who are not 21 can gamble as well.</p>
<p>If you are under 21 years old, there are other places where you can gamble in New York State. These include racetracks, Off-Track Betting (OTB) facilities, and certain lottery games. There are also casinos in other states where you can gamble if you are not yet 21 years old.</p>
<h1 id="Prince-of-Liechtenstein-to-Visit-Turning-Stone-Casino"><a href="#Prince-of-Liechtenstein-to-Visit-Turning-Stone-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Prince of Liechtenstein to Visit Turning Stone Casino"></a>Prince of Liechtenstein to Visit Turning Stone Casino</h1><p>Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein will visit the Turning Stone Casino in Verona, New York on May 17th. The Prince is a regular visitor to the casino and has been known to enjoy playing poker.</p>
<p>The visit comes at an interesting time for the casino, which is in the midst of a legal battle with the state of New York over its attempt to expand into upstate New York. The state has claimed that the casino is violating a law that prohibits gambling expansion outside of New York City.</p>
<p>Turning Stone has argued that the law applies only to commercial gambling and that its activities are exempt because they are run by a tribe of Native Americans. The case is currently being heard in front of a federal district court.</p>
<p>While the legal battle looms, the casino is hoping to put on a good show for Prince Hans-Adam II. In addition to playing poker, he is also expected to take in a show at the resort and tour its facilities.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Floor-at-Turning-Stone-Turning-into-a-Money-Maker"><a href="#Casino-Floor-at-Turning-Stone-Turning-into-a-Money-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Casino Floor at Turning Stone Turning into a Money Maker"></a>Casino Floor at Turning Stone Turning into a Money Maker</h1><p>In September of 2018, the casino floor at Turning Stone in Verona, New York became a money maker for the first time since it opened in 1993. The casino has been under pressure to turn a profit since its opening, and has seen several declines in revenue over the years. In 2017, the casino floor brought in $195 million in revenue, down from $225 million in 2013.</p>
<p>However, that changed last year when the casino floor brought in nearly $217 million. This was largely due to a new marketing strategy that focused on bringing in more high-rolling guests. In particular, the casino increased its spending on Chinese-marketing campaigns by 50 percent. This seems to have paid off, as the number of Chinese guests at the casino doubled between 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>The success of Turning Stone’s casino floor is good news for the resort as a whole. The resort has been dealing with financial troubles in recent years, and had to lay off 350 employees in 2016. The increase in revenue from the casino floor should help to prevent any more layoffs from taking place.</p>
<h1 id="Turning-Stone-Casino-Celebrates-10th-Anniversary"><a href="#Turning-Stone-Casino-Celebrates-10th-Anniversary" class="headerlink" title="Turning Stone Casino Celebrates 10th Anniversary"></a>Turning Stone Casino Celebrates 10th Anniversary</h1><p>The Turning Stone Casino and Resort is a world-renowned gaming and entertainment destination, and this year it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>To commemorate the milestone, the casino is hosting a range of special events and promotions throughout the year, including a $10,000 slot tournament in August. There will also be new restaurant openings, concerts and other happenings.</p>
<p>The AAA Four Diamond resort features three luxurious hotels, expansive gaming floors, award-winning restaurants, an arena and a spa. It has something for everyone, from serious gamblers to families looking for an enjoyable getaway.</p>
<p>Turning Stone was opened on July 20, 2008 by the Oneida Indian Nation. At the time it was hailed as one of the most impressive casinos in the world, and it has only gotten better with age. The resort employs over 4,000 people and generates more than $325 million in economic impact each year.</p>
<p>In addition to its 10th anniversary celebration, Turning Stone is marking another important milestone this year – its 25th anniversary of operations. This makes it one of the longest continuously operating casinos in North America. To commemorate this achievement, the casino will be unveiling a special exhibit later this summer that tells the story of its first 25 years.</p>
<p>Eager to experience all that Turning Stone has to offer? There’s no time like the present! Book your stay today and join in on all the fun.</p>

        <h1 id="Shade-Dominates-Reunion"><a href="#Shade-Dominates-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="Shade Dominates Reunion!"></a>Shade Dominates Reunion!</h1><p>The much anticipated Shade vs. Reunion rematch was everything the fans hoped for! Shade came out on top, convincingly dominating her opponent in every way.</p>
<p>This fight was a true test of Shade’s skills. Reunion is a seasoned fighter with years of experience. But Shade proved that she is simply the better fighter. She dominated from beginning to end, leaving her opponent battered and bruised.</p>
<p>Shade’s win is a sure sign that she is one of the best fighters in the world. She has now beaten some of the top competition, and there is no one who can challenge her supremacy.</p>
<h1 id="Shade-Continues-to-be-Most-Hit-in-Roulette-Reunion"><a href="#Shade-Continues-to-be-Most-Hit-in-Roulette-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="Shade Continues to be Most Hit in Roulette Reunion"></a>Shade Continues to be Most Hit in Roulette Reunion</h1><p>Reunion’s casino is a sight to behold - especially its roulette tables. The recent reunion of the Shade family has crowded the tables, with the eldest Shade taking the lead.</p>
<p>In particular, Shade has been hitting the table hard - and winning big. Sources say that Shade has won over 1000 gold pieces in the past day alone. This is good news for Shade, as the family had fallen on hard times in recent years.</p>
<p>Shade’s winnings are also good news for Reunion’s casino, as the influx of gold pieces will help keep the casino running smoothly. In particular, it will help pay for the casino’s new security measures, which have been put in place in response to Shade’s return.</p>
<p>security measures, which have been put in place in response to Shade’s return. While Shade continues to be the most successful player at the roulette table, other members of the Shade family are also doing well. In particular, Shade’s brother Slade has been winning consistently - something that is sure to make Shade happy.</p>
<p>With the Shades doing so well at the roulette table, there is no telling how much money Reunion’s casino will make over the course of their reunion. One thing is for sure: it is going to be a busy few days at the casino!</p>
<h1 id="Shade-Wins-Reunion-Yet-Again"><a href="#Shade-Wins-Reunion-Yet-Again" class="headerlink" title="Shade Wins Reunion Yet Again!"></a>Shade Wins Reunion Yet Again!</h1><p>Saturday night, Shade pitted his skills against reunion opponents for the fifth time and won unanimously.</p>
<p>The large, muscular lion was unfazed by his opponent’s size as he gracefully dodged and outmaneuvered them. His sharp claws ripped through flesh and bone with ease, leaving his opponents bloody and bruised.</p>
<p>This was the fifth time Shade had bested reunion opponents in a row. Some people were beginning to wonder if there was anyone left who could give him a true challenge.</p>
<p>Many spectators thought that Shade’s impressive victories were due to luck or chance, but they quickly learned that this was not the case. Shade’s skills were real and deadly.</p>
<p>Despite his many successes, Shade remains humble and is always willing to learn new techniques and strategies. He knows that there is no room for complacency in the world of competitive fighting.</p>
<h1 id="More-Proof-that-Shade-is-the-Winning-Bet-in-Roulette-Reunion"><a href="#More-Proof-that-Shade-is-the-Winning-Bet-in-Roulette-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="More Proof that Shade is the Winning Bet in Roulette Reunion"></a>More Proof that Shade is the Winning Bet in Roulette Reunion</h1><p>As roulette players continue to explore their options when it comes to betting, they often come to the same conclusion: that shade is the best bet. This type of bet is made by placing one chip on either black or red and one chip on shade (the bet that the ball will fall between zero and double-zero on the roulette wheel). The odds of winning this type of bet are much higher than any other option available in roulette, including betting on a single number.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why shade is such a strong bet in roulette. First, since there are 18 black numbers and 18 red numbers, the chance of any particular number being chosen is 1 in 36. This means that when you bet on black or red, you have a 50% chance of winning your bet. Shade, on the other hand, has a chance of winning of 2 in 38, which is about 5.3%. This means that your odds of winning with a shade bet are about 1.5 times better than betting on black or red.</p>
<p>Another reason why shade is such a good bet is because it pays out even money when you win. This means that you will get back the amount you wagered plus an additional $1 for every $10 you wager. So if you stake $10 on shade, you’ll get back $21 if you win. In comparison, if you were to wager on black or red, your payout would be only $18 – meaning that you’d lose out on $3 if the ball landed on one of those colors.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to note that while shade may have slightly longer odds than betting on black or red, it’s still not a risky bet by any means. In fact, over time your chances of winning with this type of bet will be very close to 50%, meaning that you won’t lose out too often if you choose to make this wager at the roulette table.</p>
<h1 id="Shade-Proven-Best-Strategy-at-Roulette-Reunion"><a href="#Shade-Proven-Best-Strategy-at-Roulette-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="Shade Proven Best Strategy at Roulette Reunion"></a>Shade Proven Best Strategy at Roulette Reunion</h1><p>The Shade Roulette reunion strategy has been touted as the best and most profitable approach to playing this casino game. But does it really hold up to scrutiny?</p>
<p>There is no one definitive answer to this question, as the effectiveness of the Shade Roulette reunion strategy will depend on the specifics of each individual game. However, in general, using this technique can be a very effective way to boost your odds of winning when playing roulette.</p>
<p>To execute the Shade Roulette reunion strategy, you will need to make a special bet called a “reunion”. This is a bet that is placed on two adjacent numbers that are close together on the roulette wheel. For example, you might place a reunion bet on 17 and 18, or 26 and 27.</p>
<p>The idea behind this strategy is that by betting on two adjacent numbers, you are covering more of the table than you would if you just placed a single bet on any one number. And since the odds of any one number coming up are fairly low, by spreading your bets out over multiple numbers you are increasing your chances of winning overall.</p>
<p>Another advantage of using the Shade Roulette reunion strategy is that it allows you to minimise your losses if one of your chosen numbers does not come up. If you only bet on one number and it doesn’t come up, you stand to lose your entire stake. However, if you spread your bets out over two numbers and only one of them wins, you will only lose half your stake.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that using the Shade Roulette reunion strategy will result in profits – but statistics show that it is a more successful approach than betting on a single number. In fact, if used correctly, this strategy can improve your odds of winning by around 5%. So why not give it a try the next time you play roulette?</p>

In this article, we will take a look at how sports betting works in these states and some of the rules and regulations that govern it.</p>
<p>In Nevada, all sports betting is handled by the state’s two licensed sportsbooks: The Mirage and Wynn Las Vegas. Bettors can place wagers at these sportsbooks or through their mobile apps. There are also a number of off-track betting parlors where bettors can wager on sporting events.</p>
<p>The main types of bets that are allowed in Nevada are straight bets, parlays, teasers, and futures. Bettors can also bet on propositions (or props), which are specific questions about the outcome of a game or match. For example, you might bet on whether or not the total number of points scored in a basketball game will be over&#x2F;under 190.5.</p>
<p>To place a bet in Nevada, you first need to visit a sportsbook or OTB parlor. You can then place your wager by giving the ticket writer your chosen bets. After the game has ended, you can go to one of the windows to collect your winnings (or losses).</p>
<p>In Arizona, all sports betting is handled by three tribal casinos: Casino Arizona, Desert Diamond Casino &amp; Resort - West Valley, and Gila River Casino - Wild Horse Pass. Bettors can place wagers at these casinos or through their mobile apps. There are also a number of off-track betting parlors where bettors can wager on sporting events.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Place-a-Bet-on-Sports-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#How-to-Place-a-Bet-on-Sports-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="How to Place a Bet on Sports in Las Vegas"></a>How to Place a Bet on Sports in Las Vegas</h1><p>In order to place a bet on sports in Las Vegas, you will need to do the following:</p>
<p>First, you will need to find a reputable sportsbook. There are many different sportsbooks in Las Vegas, so it is important to do your research and find one that fits your needs.</p>
<p>Next, you will need to make a deposit at the sportsbook. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as credit card, cash or check.</p>
<p>Once you have made a deposit, you can then start placing bets on your favorite teams. Most sportsbooks offer a wide range of betting options, including point spreads, moneylines and totals.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the odds at Las Vegas sportsbooks are not always the same as the odds at online sportsbooks. So be sure to shop around and find the best line for your bet.</p>
<h1 id="A-Guide-to-Sports-Betting-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#A-Guide-to-Sports-Betting-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="A Guide to Sports Betting in Las Vegas"></a>A Guide to Sports Betting in Las Vegas</h1><p>Las Vegas is the mecca for all things gambling, and that includes sports betting. Whether you’re a novice or an experienced sports bettor, there are a few tips you should know before hitting the bookmakers in Sin City.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is the types of bets that can be placed. Generally, there are three types of bets: moneyline bets, point spread bets, and totals (or over&#x2F;under) bets.</p>
<p>Moneyline bets are simply wagers on who will win the game. The point spread is the number of points by which the favored team is expected to win. Totals bets are on whether the combined score of both teams will be over or under a certain number.</p>
<p>To place a bet, you need to know the odds. Odds are expressed as either a fraction or decimal. For example, if the odds are 3&#x2F;1, that means for every $1 you bet, you would win $3 plus your original stake back. If the odds are 1.5, that means for every $1 you bet, you would win $1.50 plus your original stake back.</p>
<p>The next thing to understand is how the odds change as more money is wagered on one side or the other. This is known as the “line move” or “vigorish”. The oddsmakers adjust the line depending on how much money they’ve taken on each side of the bet. So if a lot of money is being wagered on Team A to win, the line will move in their favor and vice versa if lots of money is being wagered on Team B to win.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at an example using real world numbers from an upcoming NBA game between the Utah Jazz and Golden State Warriors. As we write this article, Utah is a 5-point underdog with odds of +200 (meaning you would win $200 for every $100 wagered). Golden State is a 7-point favorite with odds of -225 (meaning you would have to wager $225 to win $100).</p>
<p>If you wanted to bet on Utah to beat Golden State, your best option would be to place a moneyline bet at +200 rather than betting against them on the point spread (+500), which pays out only $500 for every $100 wagered if they lose by exactly 5 points. Likewise, if you wanted to bet on Golden State to beat Utah outright, your best option would be to place a moneyline bet at -225 rather than taking them on the point spread (-330), where you would only make $330 for every $100 wagered should they lose by exactly 7 points. </p>
<p>The odds attached to each type of bet will change as more money comes in on one side or another, so it’s important keep an eye on these lines moving throughout the day (or week). You can find updated odds for most sports events at websites like Vegas Insider or Odds Shark .  </p>
<p>Whether you’re in it for fun or hoping to make some serious cash, sports betting in Las Vegas can be a great experience! Just remember these key tips and you’ll be on your way to making some winning bets!</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics-of-sports-betting-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#The-Basics-of-sports-betting-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of sports betting in Las Vegas"></a>The Basics of sports betting in Las Vegas</h1><p>When it comes to sports betting in Las Vegas, there are a few things that you need to know in order to get started. First and foremost, you’ll need to find a reputable sportsbook. There are plenty of them throughout the city, so take your time and do some research before deciding on one.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a sportsbook that you feel comfortable with, the next step is to familiarize yourself with the different types of bets that are offered. The three most common bets are the point spread, the moneyline, and the over&#x2F;under.</p>
<p>The point spread is essentially a handicap placed on one of the teams in order to make the game more fair. For example, if the Miami Dolphins are playing against the New York Jets, and the point spread is set at 7 points in favor of the Jets, this means that If you bet on Miami, they have to win by more than 7 points in order for you to win your bet. If you bet on New York, they can lose by up to 7 points and you would still win your bet.</p>
<p>The moneyline is simply a bet on which team will win the game outright. There is no point spread involved here – just who will come out on top. And finally, the over&#x2F;under tells you how many points will be scored in the game combined by both teams. You can wager whether the total will be over or under that number.</p>
<p>Now that you know what each type of bet entails, it’s time to start placing some bets! Be sure to keep an eye on what teams are playing each other, as well as their odds leading up to game day. This way you can make an informed decision about which bets to place.</p>
<h1 id="Learning-how-to-bet-on-sports-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Learning-how-to-bet-on-sports-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Learning how to bet on sports in Las Vegas"></a>Learning how to bet on sports in Las Vegas</h1><p>If you’re looking to have some fun and make some money while you’re at it, then learning how to bet on sports in Las Vegas is the activity for you! There are many different ways to bet on sports, and the variety of betting options available in Las Vegas can be daunting for first-timers. But don’t worry – we’re here to help.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll teach you the basics of sports betting in Las Vegas. We’ll cover how to read a sportsbook, how to make a bet, and how to calculate your potential winnings. So whether you’re a seasoned pro or a complete novice, read on for all the information you need to get started with sports betting in Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="Learning-how-to-bet-on-sports"><a href="#Learning-how-to-bet-on-sports" class="headerlink" title="Learning how to bet on sports"></a>Learning how to bet on sports</h1><p>The first thing you need to know about betting on sports in Las Vegas is that there is no one “right” way to do it. Different people have different strategies, and what works for one person might not work for another. With that said, there are some basic tips that everyone should follow when betting on sports.</p>
<p>First and foremost, always gamble responsibly. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose, and be mindful of the odds involved in each bet. If the odds are heavily in favour of one team, it might not be worth your money to bet on the other team.</p>
<p>Additionally, be sure to do your research before making any bets. Know the teams involved, their stats, and their recent form. This will give you a better idea of which bets are likely to win and which ones are just a shot in the dark.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that gambling is supposed to be fun! Don’t take it too seriously – if you lose a few bets here and there, it’s no big deal. Gambling should always be seen as a form of entertainment, not as an investment strategy.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-read-a-sportsbook"><a href="#How-to-read-a-sportsbook" class="headerlink" title="How to read a sportsbook"></a>How to read a sportsbook</h1><p>Now that we’ve covered some basic tips for betting on sports, let’s take a look at how to actually place a bet. The first thing you need to do is find a reputable sportsbook in Las Vegas. Not all sportsbooks are created equal – some offer better odds than others, so it’s important to do your research before choosing one.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a sportsbook that suits your needs, it’s time to learn how to read its betting lines. A betting line is simply a table or chart that shows how much each team is currently being offered by the bookmaker. In most cases, the underdog (the team expected to lose) will be listed with higher odds than the favourite (the team expected to win). This is because the bookmaker expects more people will want to bet on the favourite than on the underdog.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a typical betting line: </p>
<p>  As you can see from the table above, Team A is being offered at -160 while Team B is being offered at +130. This means that if you want to bet $100 on Team A winning, they would need to win $160 in order for you to break even (i.e., including your original wager plus your return). Alternatively, if you want to bet $100 on Team B winning instead, they would only need to win $130 in order for you take home $230 (again including your original wager plus your return). So as you can see, Team B offers much better odds than Team A does!</p>

        <h1 id="Los-Blancos-suffer-third-successive-La-Liga-home-defeat"><a href="#Los-Blancos-suffer-third-successive-La-Liga-home-defeat" class="headerlink" title="Los Blancos suffer third successive La Liga home defeat"></a>Los Blancos suffer third successive La Liga home defeat</h1><p>Real Madrid slumped to their third successive home defeat in La Liga as they went down 2-1 to Villarreal on Saturday.</p>
<p>The result means that Los Blancos have now lost four of their last five matches in all competitions, and they remain four points adrift of fourth-placed Valencia.</p>
<p>Villarreal took the lead in the first half through Manu Trigueros, before Cristiano Ronaldo levelled things up shortly after the interval. However, Samu Castillejo restored Villarreal’s lead soon afterwards and they held on for the win.</p>
<p>Real Madrid began brightly and almost took the lead in the sixth minute, but Karim Benzema’s header came back off the crossbar. Villarreal gradually grew into the game and took the lead in the 20th minute through Trigueros, who finished neatly from close range following a well-worked team move.</p>
<p>The hosts continued to press for an equaliser and eventually got one through Ronaldo in the 47th minute. The Portuguese superstar volleyed home from 12 yards out after Luka Modric had played him in with a superb ball over the top.</p>
<p>However, Villarreal hit back immediately through Castillejo, who raced clear before finishing clinically past Keylor Navas. The visitors went on to hold on for the win, despite Real Madrid’s best efforts to find an equaliser.</p>
<p>It was a hugely disappointing result for Santiago Solari’s side, who are now facing an uphill task if they are to qualify for next season’s Champions League.</p>
<h1 id="Atletico-Madrid-return-to-winning-ways-with-2-1-victory-over-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Atletico-Madrid-return-to-winning-ways-with-2-1-victory-over-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Atlético Madrid return to winning ways with 2-1 victory over Real Madrid"></a>Atlético Madrid return to winning ways with 2-1 victory over Real Madrid</h1><p>Atlético Madrid secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory over rivals Real Madrid in La Liga on Saturday. Antoine Griezmann scored both goals for the home side, with Karim Benzema netting a late consolation for Madrid.</p>
<p>It was a lively opening to the match at the Wanda Metropolitano, with Atlético quickly establishing themselves as the dominant force. Griezmann came close to putting the hosts ahead in the 11th minute but his effort sailed just wide of the post.</p>
<p>The breakthrough finally came in the 27th minute, with Griezmann volleying home from close range following a well-worked free-kick. Madrid responded before half-time but they were unable to find an equaliser, with Thibaut Courtois making some fine saves to keep them at bay.</p>
<p>Atlético continued to dominate after the break and they doubled their lead in the 67th minute, with Griezmann scoring his second of the game with a well-placed finish. Los Blancos did pull one back in injury time through Benzema, but it was too little, too late as Atlético held on for all three points.</p>
<p>The result sees Diego Simeone’s side move up to second place in La Liga, just two points behind leaders Barcelona. Meanwhile, Real Madrid have now lost two of their last three league games and they find themselves down in fifth place.</p>
<h1 id="Diego-Costa-scores-winner-on-Atleti-return"><a href="#Diego-Costa-scores-winner-on-Atleti-return" class="headerlink" title="Diego Costa scores winner on Atleti return"></a>Diego Costa scores winner on Atleti return</h1><p>Diego Costa marked his return to Atletico Madrid with a last-minute winner in a 2-1 victory over Getafe on Saturday.</p>
<p>The striker, who rejoined the club from Chelsea in January, had not played for Atleti since 2014 due to a falling out with then-coach Diego Simeone.</p>
<p>But he came off the bench to score the decisive goal at the Wanda Metropolitano, stabbing home Antoine Griezmann’s cross in the 90th minute.</p>
<p>“It was very emotional to score that goal and win in my first game back,” Costa said. “I’m very happy.”</p>
<p>Atletico had taken an early lead through Jorge “Koke” Resurreccion, but Getafe equalised shortly before halftime through Faycal Fajr.</p>
<p>Simeone’s side have now won four La Liga games in a row to close the gap on fourth-placed Real Madrid to four points.</p>
<h1 id="Cristiano-Ronaldo-scores-400th-career-goal-in-derby-draw"><a href="#Cristiano-Ronaldo-scores-400th-career-goal-in-derby-draw" class="headerlink" title="Cristiano Ronaldo scores 400th career goal in derby draw"></a>Cristiano Ronaldo scores 400th career goal in derby draw</h1><p>Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player ever to score in every minute of a La Liga game as he registered his 400th career goal in a 1-1 draw with Barcelona. The Portuguese international opened the scoring at the Nou Camp in the third minute and then found the net again in the 90th minute, meaning he has now scored in every minute of a La Liga game.</p>
<p>Ronaldo’s strike was his fifth goal in this season’s El Clasico fixtures and it means he has now overtaken Alfredo Di Stefano as Real Madrid’s all-time top scorer in derby games. The 33-year-old has now scored 23 goals against Barcelona, four more than any other player.</p>
<p>“It was an important goal because it was in a difficult match against a tough opponent,” Ronaldo said afterwards. “To score 400 goals for any club is not easy, so I am very happy. It was a difficult match but we deserved to win because we played better. Football is like that, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. We have to continue doing our job.”</p>
<p>This season, Ronaldo has already scored 29 goals in just 27 appearances for Real Madrid and he is on course to break his own record of 50 goals set last season.</p>
<h1 id="Atletico-Madrid-stay-unbeaten-in-La-Liga-under-Diego-Simeone"><a href="#Atletico-Madrid-stay-unbeaten-in-La-Liga-under-Diego-Simeone" class="headerlink" title="Atlético Madrid stay unbeaten in La Liga under Diego Simeone"></a>Atlético Madrid stay unbeaten in La Liga under Diego Simeone</h1><p>In the five and a half years since Diego Simeone took charge of Atlético Madrid, they have never been relegated from La Liga and they have only missed out on Europe once. This season is no different, as they are still unbeaten in La Liga and currently sit in second place – just two points behind Barcelona.</p>
<p>There have been a few bumps in the road this season, with Atlético losing to Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final and also suffering defeat to Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup. However, they have bounced back each time and currently sit top of their Europa League group.</p>
<p>Under Diego Simeone, Atlético Madrid have become one of the most successful clubs in Europe. They have won the Europa League twice, the Copa del Rey once and La Liga twice. They have also reached two Champions League finals, but unfortunately lost both times.</p>
<p>Despite all their success under Simeone, there have been reports that he could be leaving Atlético at the end of this season. He has been linked with a number of jobs, including Arsenal and Manchester United, but nothing has been confirmed as yet.</p>
<p>If Diego Simeone does leave Atlético Madrid at the end of this season, it will be a massive loss for the club. He has done an incredible job over the past five and a half years and has turned Atlético into one of the best clubs in Europe.</p>
