#  Antiquarian bookseller almost done with B. Flaubert manuscript

Rare bookseller Simon Finch is almost done with a manuscript of "Bouvard et Pecuchet" by French author Gustave Flaubert. The manuscript is expected to bring in a large profit as there are only a few left in the world.

Finch acquired the manuscript at an auction last year and has been working on restoring it to its original condition. The manuscript is written entirely in pencil and is missing its cover and first pages.

"It's a difficult process but it's worth it in the end," said Finch. "The book is over two hundred years old and it's amazing that it's still in tact."

Finch plans to sell the manuscript for upwards of $100,000. He anticipates there will be a lot of interest from collectors around the world.

#  Bodley Head to publish new Flaubert biography 

Bodley Head has announced that it will publish a new biography of Gustave Flaubert by Oxford professor and biographer Philip Brett.

The new book, provisionally entitled "Flaubert: A Writer in His World", is described by the publisher as "the first full-length, single-volume biography of Flaubert for over thirty years". It will explore the writer's life and work in the context of his times, with a focus on his relationships with other writers, artists and thinkers.

Commenting on the announcement, Bodley Head publisher Stephen Page said: "Flaubert is one of the giants of world literature, and I am immensely proud that Bodley Head is to publish Philip Brett's revelatory new biography. This is a book that will set the standard for all future work on Flaubert."

Philip Brett added: "Flaubert remains one of the most widely read novelists in the world, but he remains curiously under-examined. My aim has been to give readers a Flaubert who is both deeply embedded in his own time and culture, and who speaks to us with undiminished power today."

#  How old was Flaubert when he wrote his famous books?

Flaubert was a French author who is considered one of the great masters of the 19th century. Some of his famous books include "Madame Bovary" and "Salammbo". Many people are curious about how old he was when he wrote these books.

While the exact dates are unknown, it is believed that Flaubert started writing "Madame Bovary" when he was around 26 years old. He finished it when he was 29. As for "Salammbo", it is believed that he started working on it when he was 31 and finished when he was 34. So, in total, Flaubert was around 28-35 years old when he wrote his most famous books.

#  Scholar suggests Flaubert was born in 1821, not 1820 
Scholar Michael Maier has suggested that Gustave Flaubert was actually born on 12 December 1821, not 12 December 1820 as has been traditionally claimed. 

This news has caused much excitement in the literary world, as it means that Flaubert’s masterpiece “Madame Bovary” was actually written when the author was just 20 years old, and not 21 as had been previously believed. 

Many experts have long suspected that Flaubert may have lied about his age, in order to give his work an air of greater maturity. This new evidence seems to support this theory. 

It is also interesting to note that if Flaubert was indeed born in 1821, this would mean that he was only 16 years old when he began writing “Madame Bovary” – an impressively young age for such a complex and accomplished novel. 

Naturally, many questions still remain to be answered. For instance, why would Flaubert choose to lie about his age? And what other works might he have produced had he not started writing at such a young age? 

Only further research will provide answers to these questions. In the meantime, scholars and literary fans around the world are busy debating the implications of this new information.

#  Despite new evidence, debate over Flaubert's year of birth rages on

Flaubert's birth year has been a topic of debate for many years. Some say he was born in 1821, while others believe it was 1819. New evidence has recently come to light that may finally put this argument to rest.

In a letter from Flaubert's aunt, Marie-Alicia Poiret, to her niece Louise Flaubert, she writes: "My brother Achille was born on December 12, 1798... Gustave was born December 12, 1821" (1). This would seem to prove that Flaubert was born in 1821. However, some argue that the date given in the letter is not Flaubert's birth date, but the day he was baptized.

In order to settle this argument once and for all, scholars have looked at baptismal records from the time period. These records show that Flaubert was baptized on December 12, 1819 (2). This would seem to support the theory that Flaubert was actually born in 1819.

So which date is correct? The answer is likely that both dates are correct. It is possible that Marie-Alicia Poiret made a mistake in her letter and wrote the date of Flaubert's baptism instead of his birth date. Or it could be that Flaubert himself changed his birthdate at some point in his life. We may never know for sure which date is correct, but the evidence seems to suggest that Flaubert was born in 1819.
