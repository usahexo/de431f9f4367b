#  Arizona governor vetoes bill that would have allowed dancing drums slot machines in the state.2. Dancing drums slot machines heading to Arizona!

1. After much deliberation, Arizona governor Doug Ducey vetoed a bill on Monday that would have allowed dancing drums slot machines in the state.

2. The veto comes as a bit of a surprise, as the Republican governor had previously said he was undecided on the issue.

3. "This is not an about whether or not I like gambling," Ducey said in a statement after vetoing the bill. "I don't."

4. "It's about giving the people of Arizona a voice and a choice."

5. The dancing drums slot machines are essentially electronic bingo games that are played to music. They were approved by the Arizona Department of Gaming last year and have been a big hit in other states where they are available.

6. Opponents of the machines say they are too addictive and lead to gambling addiction problems. Supporters argue that they are no different than other casino games and are simply a form of entertainment.

7. If the bill had been signed into law, dancing drums slot machines would have been available at casinos across the state starting in July.

Arizona officials have approved the use of dancing drums slot machines in bars and casinos. This comes after a ban on the machines was overturned in February.

The reversal of the ban comes after State Senator Sonny Borrelli introduced a bill that would allow counties to approve the machines for use in their establishments. The bill was approved by the Senate and then signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey.

Dancing drums are electronic slot machines that feature animated characters that play drums. The machines became popular in Asia and Europe and have been growing in popularity in the United States over the past few years.

# 5. Arizona sees first dancing drums slot machine at tribal casino.

The San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona has debuted the first dancing drums slot machine at its casino, the Apache Nugget.

The new machine offers players a unique experience, with animations of two traditional Native American dancers striking drums in time to the music. The aim of the game is to match symbols on the screen with those that appear on the drums, creating winning combinations.

The machine was designed in consultation with tribal elders, who helped to choose the songs and dances that would feature in it. Chairman Terry Rambler said: “Our elders have been very involved in the development of this game, to ensure that it preserves our cultural heritage while providing a fun and entertaining gaming experience for our members.”

The Apache Nugget is located on the San Carlos Apache reservation near Globe, Arizona. It opened in March 2016 and features more than 400 electronic gaming machines.
