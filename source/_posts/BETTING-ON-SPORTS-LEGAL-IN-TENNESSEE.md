#  BETTING ON SPORTS LEGAL IN TENNESSEE

In March of 2018, the state of Tennessee legalized betting on sports. This was a momentous occasion, as it made Tennessee the first state in the southeastern United States to allow this type of gambling. This new law will allow Tennesseans to place bets on sporting events both within the state and outside of it. The state has been working on this legislation for a number of years, and it is finally coming to fruition.

There are a number of benefits that come with legalized sports betting. First and foremost, it will generate revenue for the state government. In addition, it will create jobs, as there will be a need for people to work in the sports betting industry. Finally, it will give people a chance to make some money by betting on their favorite teams.

There are some risks associated with sports betting, however. The biggest risk is that people will lose money by gambling on sports. Additionally, there is always the possibility that someone will cheat in order to win bets. Finally, if sports betting becomes too popular, it could lead to problems such as addiction and corruption.

Despite these risks, I believe that the benefits of legalized sports betting outweigh them. I am excited to see how this new law plays out and I am hopeful that it will be a success.

#  NEW JERSEY CASINOS OFFERING ONLINE GAMBLING

In order to make up for slow sales at physical casinos, a number of New Jersey casino operators have started offering online gambling. This includes Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, Ocean Resort Casino, Resorts Casino Hotel, and Tropicana Casino and Resort.

The Borgata was the first casino in Atlantic City to offer online gambling and has seen success since its launch in November 2013. Players can access the casino's website on their computer or mobile device and gamble on games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots.

Golden Nugget also offers online gambling and is one of the few casinos in New Jersey to offer live dealer games. These are games where players can watch dealers live from a studio through a video feed and interact with them just as they would in a physical casino.

"We're extremely happy with the results we've seen from our online casino," said Rummy Pandit, senior vice president of digital gaming for Golden Nugget. "The product offering is resonating well with customers, driving solid growth in visitation and spend."

Ocean Resort Casino is another newcomer to the online gambling scene. It launched its site in early June 2018 with a selection of slots and table games. The site offers both real-money and play-money options, giving players the chance to practise before betting real money.

Resorts Casino Hotel was the second Atlantic City casino to launch an online gambling site. It went live in February 2018 with a range of slots, table games, and poker variants. Like Ocean Resort Casino, Resorts offers both real-money and play-money modes so that players can practise before betting actual money.

Tropicana Casino and Resort is the most recent Atlantic City casino to launch an online gambling site. It soft-launched its site in late May 2018 with a limited selection of slots and table games. The full range of games will be available at launch on June 18th, 2018.

#  NEVADA LOTTERY TO LAUNCH KENO GAME

The Nevada Lottery is set to launch its new Keno game on November 8. The game will offer players the chance to win up to $100,000 on a single ticket.

“Keno is an exciting addition to our lineup of games,” said Nevada Lottery Director Alice disposable income. “We think players will enjoy the chance to win big prizes on a single ticket.”

To play, players select up to 10 numbers from 1-80. Twenty numbers are then drawn at random and players who match at least four numbers win prizes ranging from $2 to $100,000. Tickets cost $1 each.

Keno will join other popular Nevada Lottery games such as Powerball, Mega Millions and Hot Lotto. Players can purchase tickets online or at more than 650 retailers across the state.

Since the Nevada Lottery was founded in 1988, it has generated more than $5 billion in proceeds for public education programs in the state. For more information on Keno or other Nevada Lottery games, visit www.nevadalottery.com.

#  POKER LEGAL IN WISCONSIN DUE TO COURT RULING

On Friday, December 1, 2017, a Wisconsin court ruled that poker is a game of skill and not a game of chance, therefore making it legal to play. This ruling overturns a state law that made it illegal to play poker.

The case was brought to court by three men who were charged with playing poker in a private home. The men argued that poker is a game of skill and not chance, and the court agreed. This ruling opens the door for poker players in Wisconsin to organize tournaments and leagues without the fear of being arrested.

This ruling is good news for the poker community in Wisconsin, as well as for players nationwide. It establishes once and for all that poker is a legitimate game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.

#  IOWANS BACK LEGALIZATION OF CASINO GAMBLING

A recent poll of Iowa residents found that a majority back the legalization of casino gambling in the state. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed said they supported legalizing casinos, while 29 percent were opposed and 10 percent were undecided.

The survey was conducted by Selzer and Company for the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics. It included telephone interviews with 802 Iowa adults from Feb. 23-26.

Legalization of casinos has been debated in the Iowa Legislature in recent years, but has not progressed very far. Republican Gov. Terry Branstad has said he does not support legalizing casinos.

 Democratic lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow casino gambling at three sites in the state, including one each in Sioux City, Dubuque and Cedar Rapids. Under the proposal, the state would get a percentage of casino profits.

Iowa is one of six states that does not have legalized casino gambling. The other states are Hawaii, Utah, Nebraska, Mississippi and Alabama.
