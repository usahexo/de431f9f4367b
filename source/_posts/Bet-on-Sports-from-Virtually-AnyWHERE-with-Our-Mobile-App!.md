#  Now that Mobile Sports Betting is Legal in These States, How Will it Impact the Industry?

With more and more states legalizing mobile sports betting, the industry is experiencing rapid growth. But how will this growth impact the industry as a whole? And what are the benefits of mobile sports betting for players?

The Benefits of Mobile Sports Betting

There are many benefits to mobile sports betting. For starters, it’s convenient – you can place bets from anywhere at any time. And since most mobile sportsbooks offer live betting, you can bet on games as they’re happening. This adds an extra layer of excitement to the game.

Another benefit is that mobile sportsbooks typically have better odds than land-based casinos. Plus, they offer a wider variety of bets, so you can find the bet that’s right for you. And because there’s no need to leave your home, you can save time and money on transportation costs.

How Mobile Sports Betting Will Impact the Industry

Mobile sports betting is rapidly growing in popularity, and it’s poised to have a big impact on the industry. In fact, according to a study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC., by 2021 over half of all sports bets will be placed through mobile devices.

This growth is largely due to the convenience and flexibility that mobile sports betting offers players. With more states legalizing it, more people are able to take advantage of its benefits. And as more people start using mobile sportsbooks, the industry will continue to grow.

This growth is good news for players, as it means they’ll have access to better odds and a wider variety of bets. It also means that they can place bets anytime and anywhere – which adds an extra layer of excitement to the game.

#  Finally, Legalized Mobile Sports Betting Across Selected U.S. States

In May of 2018, the United States Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in favor of legalized sports betting across the nation. The decision effectively overturned a 1992 federal law that had banned single-game sports wagers in every state but Nevada.

Naturally, this created a flurry of activity among states to develop legislation and regulations to allow for such gambling within their borders. And while some have been more aggressive than others in getting things up and running, there is now a slowly growing patchwork of legal sports betting in the United States.

Alaska, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, and West Virginia were among the first states to legalize mobile sports betting after the SCOTUS ruling. More recently, Pennsylvania followed suit, as did Rhode Island and Tennessee.

Hawaii may be next in line – lawmakers there are currently considering a bill that would legalize wagers both online and through retail sports books. And Oklahoma is also eyeing legalization after seeing how much revenue other states are bringing in from sports betting taxes.

So just how big has this market become? According to Eilers & Krejcik Gaming research, states with legalized sports betting will bring in an estimated $8 billion in bets this year alone. That number is expected to grow to $16 billion by 2023.

A big part of that growth will come from increasing legalization of mobile betting. In fact, it’s projected that over 60% of all sports betting activity will take place online by 2023. This burgeoning market is ripe for investment, so if you’re looking for some promising opportunities in the space, look no further!

#  Which States Allow Mobile Sports Betting?

As sports betting continues to gain in popularity, more and more states are starting to legalize it. This is great news for those who love to place bets on their favorite teams, as it means that they can now do so from anywhere in the country.

So far, only a handful of states allow mobile sports betting, but that number is expected to grow in the coming years. Let’s take a look at which states currently allow it, and how you can go about placing bets from your phone or tablet.

# Delaware

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize sports betting, and it currently has the most liberal laws when it comes to mobile wagering. As long as you are physically located within state lines, you are allowed to place bets using your phone or tablet.

There are several apps available that allow residents of Delaware to bet on sports, including DraftKings and BetStars. You can also place bets through the websites of local casinos like Caesar’s Palace and Dover Downs.

# New Jersey

New Jersey was one of the first states to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court decision in 2018. In addition to traditional sports betting options at land-based casinos, New Jersey also offers mobile betting through its app, NJ Sportsbook.

You can download the NJ Sportsbook app for free on both Android and iOS devices. Once you have registered for an account, you can start placing bets on all your favorite teams. The app offers live odds and point spreads, as well as in-game wagering opportunities.

# West Virginia
West Virginia became the third state in the US to offer legal sports betting after the Supreme Court ruling in 2018. There are currently two land-based casinos in West Virginia that offer sports betting services: The Greenbrier Resort and Mountaineer Casino Racetrack & Resort.

However, only The Greenbrier Resort offers mobile betting services at this time. You can download the The Greenbrier app for free on Android and iOS devices, and start placing bets on all your favorite teams right from your phone or tablet.
