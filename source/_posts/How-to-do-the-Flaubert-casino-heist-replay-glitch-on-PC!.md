#  The Flaubert casino heist replay glitch – how to make easy money!

The Flaubert casino heist is a great way to make easy money, but some players have discovered a replay glitch that can allow them to make even more money with very little effort!

To exploit the glitch, start the heist and then quickly exit out to the main menu. Once you’re back on the main menu, select “Restart Heist” and then quickly exit out again. This time, select “Replay Mission” and play through the heist until you reach the part where you need to pick up the bag of cash.

Once you have the bag of cash, instead of picking it up, run towards the exit and jump out of the level. You will then respawn back at the start of the level with the bag of cash still in your inventory! Simply repeat this process as many times as you like to earn easy money!

Note that you will need to be patient and quick when restarting the heist, as if you take too long between selections on the main menu, the game will start loading and you will not be able to exploit the glitch.

#  How to cheat your way through the Flaubert casino heist!

Being an expert thief, you know that the Flaubert casino is the perfect place to pull off a heist. However, you also know that the security is tight, so you need a plan.

First, you'll need to find out where the security cameras are and what their fields of view are. This information can be found in the casino's security manual. Once you know where the cameras are, you'll need to figure out how to avoid them.

One way to do this is by using distraction techniques. For example, you could create a distraction by setting off a fire alarm or throwing a rock through a window. Alternatively, you could use decoys to divert the attention of the security guards.

If possible, it's also a good idea to have an escape route planned in advance. This could involve using a getaway car or escaping through a ventilation shaft.

Once you've put your plan into action, it's important to stay calm and avoid making any sudden movements. If you can make it through the casino undetected, you'll be one step closer to stealing those precious jewels!

## The Flaubert Casino Heist

The Flaubert Casino Heist is an online heist in Grand Theft Auto Online, released on October 2nd, 2018. It is accessed via the internet and can be played by up to four players.

The heist is set at the Flaubert Casino, a luxury casino in Blaine County. The player must rob the casino while avoiding the security guards and the police. The heist has two stages: the first stage is robbery, where the players must steal a large sum of money from the casino vault; and the second stage is escape, where the players must escape with the money and avoid being arrested.

The heist can be completed in various ways, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we will exploit a glitch that allows us to complete the heist in minutes for a large sum of money.

## The Glitch

The glitch involves taking advantage of a bug that allows players to replay the first stage of the heist over and over again for an unlimited amount of money. The bug occurs when a player disconnects from GTA Online during or after the first stage of the heist. If done correctly, the player will be able to replay the first stage of the heist an infinite number of times.

To exploit this glitch, follow these steps:
1) Enter GTA Online and start up The Flaubert Casino Heist. 
2) Disconnect from GTA Online during or after you have robbed the casino vault. 
3) Re-enter GTA Online and start up The Flaubert Casino Heist again. 
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as you want for an unlimited amount of money.
