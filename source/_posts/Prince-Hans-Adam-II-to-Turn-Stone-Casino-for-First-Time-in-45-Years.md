#  Prince Hans-Adam II to Turn Stone Casino for First Time in 45 Years

Prince Hans-Adam II, the long reigning monarch of Liechtenstein, is set to turn the casino in his principality for the first time in 45 years this weekend.

The 64-year-old prince is a known gambler, and is expected to place some high-stakes bets at the table games inside the Stone Casino.

"This will be a special occasion for the Prince," said a spokesperson for Hans-Adam. "He has not visited the casino since he was 19 years old."

Hans-Adam's father, Franz Joseph II, opened the casino in 1971. The younger prince took over as ruler of Liechtenstein following his father's death in 1989.

The casino is open daily from 10am to 2am, and features blackjack, roulette and poker tables.

#  How Old Do You Have to Be to Gamble at Turn Stone Casino?

If you are looking to gamble at the Turn Stone Casino, you must be at least 21 years old. This is because the casino follows the New York State law which states that anyone who is 21 or older can gamble in a casino.

There are some exceptions to this rule, however. If you are visiting the casino from another country and are over the age of 18, you will be able to gamble at the casino. There are also some special events at the casino where people who are not 21 can gamble as well.

If you are under 21 years old, there are other places where you can gamble in New York State. These include racetracks, Off-Track Betting (OTB) facilities, and certain lottery games. There are also casinos in other states where you can gamble if you are not yet 21 years old.

#  Prince of Liechtenstein to Visit Turning Stone Casino




Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein will visit the Turning Stone Casino in Verona, New York on May 17th. The Prince is a regular visitor to the casino and has been known to enjoy playing poker.

The visit comes at an interesting time for the casino, which is in the midst of a legal battle with the state of New York over its attempt to expand into upstate New York. The state has claimed that the casino is violating a law that prohibits gambling expansion outside of New York City.

Turning Stone has argued that the law applies only to commercial gambling and that its activities are exempt because they are run by a tribe of Native Americans. The case is currently being heard in front of a federal district court.

While the legal battle looms, the casino is hoping to put on a good show for Prince Hans-Adam II. In addition to playing poker, he is also expected to take in a show at the resort and tour its facilities.

#  Casino Floor at Turning Stone Turning into a Money Maker

In September of 2018, the casino floor at Turning Stone in Verona, New York became a money maker for the first time since it opened in 1993. The casino has been under pressure to turn a profit since its opening, and has seen several declines in revenue over the years. In 2017, the casino floor brought in $195 million in revenue, down from $225 million in 2013.

However, that changed last year when the casino floor brought in nearly $217 million. This was largely due to a new marketing strategy that focused on bringing in more high-rolling guests. In particular, the casino increased its spending on Chinese-marketing campaigns by 50 percent. This seems to have paid off, as the number of Chinese guests at the casino doubled between 2017 and 2018.

The success of Turning Stone's casino floor is good news for the resort as a whole. The resort has been dealing with financial troubles in recent years, and had to lay off 350 employees in 2016. The increase in revenue from the casino floor should help to prevent any more layoffs from taking place.

#  Turning Stone Casino Celebrates 10th Anniversary

The Turning Stone Casino and Resort is a world-renowned gaming and entertainment destination, and this year it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary.

To commemorate the milestone, the casino is hosting a range of special events and promotions throughout the year, including a $10,000 slot tournament in August. There will also be new restaurant openings, concerts and other happenings.

The AAA Four Diamond resort features three luxurious hotels, expansive gaming floors, award-winning restaurants, an arena and a spa. It has something for everyone, from serious gamblers to families looking for an enjoyable getaway.

Turning Stone was opened on July 20, 2008 by the Oneida Indian Nation. At the time it was hailed as one of the most impressive casinos in the world, and it has only gotten better with age. The resort employs over 4,000 people and generates more than $325 million in economic impact each year.

In addition to its 10th anniversary celebration, Turning Stone is marking another important milestone this year – its 25th anniversary of operations. This makes it one of the longest continuously operating casinos in North America. To commemorate this achievement, the casino will be unveiling a special exhibit later this summer that tells the story of its first 25 years.
