#  Vegas Casino Heist Nets $6M in Winnings!

The heist that many in the Vegas casino community are still talking about happened a little over a week ago, on the night of July 29th. At around 10pm, four masked men walked into the Bellagio Casino and headed for the high-roller section. They had apparently cased the joint and knew where they were going.

 Without warning, they pulled out handguns and began yelling at everyone to get down. One of the waitstaff was in the process of serving drinks to some high rollers when he was ordered to get down on the floor. He complied, but not before reaching for the panic button under the bar.

The gunmen then proceeded to rob several of the high-rollers at gunpoint, making off with over $6 million in winnings. They fled the scene in a black SUV that had been waiting for them outside.

Police are still investigating and have released very few details about the robbery. No one has been arrested and no suspects have been identified. The only thing that is known for sure is that those responsible are extremely skilled at what they do and planned this robbery very carefully.

This is not the first time a major casino heist has taken place in Vegas. In 2010, two men walked into the Aria Casino and stole nearly $1 million from the high-roller area. And just last year, three men robbed Caesar's Palace of more than $1 million. So while it may be alarming that this is becoming more common, it's not exactly unheard of either.

Casinos have been beefing up security measures in recent years in an attempt to prevent these types of robberies, but clearly they are not foolproof. It will be interesting to see if any additional security measures are put into place in light of this latest robbery, or if casinos just have to accept that this is something that could happen from time to time.

In either case, it's clear that those responsible for robbing the Bellagio Casino know what they're doing and are very lucky (or skilled) enough to have walked away with over $6 million in cash.

#  Casino Robbery: Suspect on the Loose with $1.5M in Winnings!

Las Vegas, NV – Feb 3, 2019: A brazen casino robbery took place early this morning at the Bellagio Resort and Casino. The suspect, armed with a handgun, made off with over $1.5 million in cash and casino chips.

This is not the first time the Bellagio has been targeted by thieves; in fact, it’s one of the most commonly robbed casinos in the world. In 2010, an armed man made off with over $1 million in chips, and in 2012, a group of men robbed the casino of more than $40,000 worth of cash and chips.

The latest robbery is still under investigation, but police have released a description of the suspect. He is said to be a white male in his mid-20s, approximately 6’0” tall and 150 lbs. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, black pants and a black ski mask.

If you have any information about this crime or the identity of the suspect, please contact Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.

#  Police Seek Public's Help in Identifying Casino Heist Suspect

The Casino Robbery Unit is asking for the public’s help in identifying a suspect who robbed the Lady Luck Casino at gunpoint on Thursday, January 31, 2019.

At approximately 2:15 a.m., the suspect entered the casino and approached a female employee at the cashier’s cage. He pointed a handgun at her and demanded money. The victim complied and the suspect fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash.

No one was injured in this incident.

The Casino Robbery Unit is asking anyone with information about this incident to contact them at 702-828-3591 or Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.

#  FBI Seeks Information on Las Vegas Casino Heist

The FBI is investigating a heist that took place at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. The thieves stole an undisclosed amount of money from the casino’s cashier cage.

No arrests have been made and the FBI is asking for the public’s help in identifying the suspects.

This is not the first time that the Bellagio has been targeted by thieves. In 2010, a group of men robbed the casino of more than $1 million dollars.

The FBI released surveillance footage of the latest robbery and asked anyone with information about the suspects to contact them.

#  Man Charged in $1.5M Casino Heist

A 30-year-old man has been charged in a $1.5 million casino heist earlier this year.

According to the criminal complaint, the man entered the casino on January 15th, 2018, and went to the high-limit gaming area. There, he approached a blackjack table and asked the dealer for $5,000 in chips. The dealer turned over the chips, and the man fled the scene.

Surveillance footage from the casino showed that the man had also stolen chips from two other tables before fleeing.

The man was arrested last week and has been charged with third-degree robbery. If convicted, he could face up to seven years in prison.

This is not the first time that a casino has been robbed in this manner. In fact, this type of robbery is becoming increasingly common as thieves target small amounts of cash from casinos rather than trying to rob armored cars or banks.

In order to combat this type of theft, many casinos are now using chip readers that can detect if a chip has been stolen. This has helped to reduce the number of chip thefts at casinos, but it has not stopped them altogether.
