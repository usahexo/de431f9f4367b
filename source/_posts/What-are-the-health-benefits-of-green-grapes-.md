#  Are there any specific compounds in green grapes that offer health benefits? 

The answer to this question is yes, there are numerous health benefits associated with consuming green grapes. This is because these grapes are typically rich in antioxidants, which scavenge harmful toxins and byproducts that can damage cells.

#  How much grapes should someone eat to reap the health benefits?

One recent study published in Nutrients​​ found that the polyphenols in grapes can improve sleep quality. While the study only looked at red and black grapes, both of which are high in polyphenols, researchers believe that other types of grapes would have a similar effect. Polyphenols are plant-based nutrients found in many fruits and vegetables.

So, how many grapes should you eat to reap these benefits? Unfortunately, there’s no definitive answer. The polyphenol content of grapes varies depending on the variety and how they’re processed. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, one serving of grapes is around 12 grapes. This means that you’d need to eat at least 144 grapes per day to significantly boost your polyphenol intake.

If you don’t want to eat that many grapes, there are other ways to get your daily dose of polyphenols. For example, you could try incorporating grape skins or grape seed oil into your diet. Grape skins are high in polyphenols and are usually removed during processing. However, they can be eaten whole or used in recipes such as jam or juice. Grape seed oil is also high in polyphenols and has a host of other health benefits such as reducing inflammation and promoting heart health.
