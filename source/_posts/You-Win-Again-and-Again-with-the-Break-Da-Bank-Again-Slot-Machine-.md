1. Choose the right time to play

Many casinos offer bonuses to players who sign up or make a deposit. Be sure to take advantage of these bonuses, but don’t go overboard. The last thing you want is to end up in debt because of your gambling habit. Use bonuses as a way to increase your profits, not as a way to gamble away more money than you can afford to lose.
